 Number of months from Baseline to first prednisone burst.  With the exception of a visit at 2 months, vists are four months apart.  At each visit a participant answers whether prednisone was used since the previous visit.  If prednisone had been used, the value of this variable is the number of months that the visit is from Baseline.  For example, if the first burst was used between the four month and the eight month visit, the pred_bursts_event1_month variable has a value of eight assigned.
