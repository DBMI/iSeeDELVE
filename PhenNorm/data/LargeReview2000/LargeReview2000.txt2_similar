It seeks to identify an orthogonal coordinate system that transforms a number of possibly correlated variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables called principal components (PC). This method allows for the separation of individuals on the basis of differences in their properties and can also be used to evaluate the properties that contribute the most to these separations. The principal components are ordered in terms of the amount of variation in the dataset that they explain such that the first PC explains the largest fraction of the total variance, and so on. There exist a number of methods to determine the number of PC to be retained for a specific analysis. However, none of them uniformly dominates the others. Following a practice largely adopted in the field, we present the first 10 PC computed on this dataset.

It seeks to identify an orthogonal coordinate system that transforms a number of possibly correlated variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables called principal components (PC). This method allows for the separation of individuals on the basis of differences in their properties and can also be used to evaluate the properties that contribute the most to these separations. The principal components are ordered in terms of the amount of variation in the dataset that they explain such that the first PC explains the largest fraction of the total variance, and so on. There exist a number of methods to determine the number of PC to be retained for a specific analysis. However, none of them uniformly dominates the others. Following a practice largely adopted in the field, we present the first 10 PC computed on this dataset.

	phv00076436.v1  	 " Principal component 4: a mathematical tool commonly used in statistical analysis. It seeks to identify an orthogonal coordinate system that transforms a number of possibly correlated variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables called principal components (PC). This method allows for the separation of individuals on the basis of differences in their properties and can also be used to evaluate the properties that contribute the most to these separations. The principal components are ordered in terms of the amount of variation in the dataset that they explain such that the first PC explains the largest fraction of the total variance, and so on. There exist a number of methods to determine the number of PC to be retained for a specific analysis. However, none of them uniformly dominates the others. Following a practice largely adopted in the field, we present the first 10 PC computed on this dataset.

It seeks to identify an orthogonal coordinate system that transforms a number of possibly correlated variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables called principal components (PC). This method allows for the separation of individuals on the basis of differences in their properties and can also be used to evaluate the properties that contribute the most to these separations. The principal components are ordered in terms of the amount of variation in the dataset that they explain such that the first PC explains the largest fraction of the total variance, and so on. There exist a number of methods to determine the number of PC to be retained for a specific analysis. However, none of them uniformly dominates the others. Following a practice largely adopted in the field, we present the first 10 PC computed on this dataset.

It seeks to identify an orthogonal coordinate system that transforms a number of possibly correlated variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables called principal components (PC). This method allows for the separation of individuals on the basis of differences in their properties and can also be used to evaluate the properties that contribute the most to these separations. The principal components are ordered in terms of the amount of variation in the dataset that they explain such that the first PC explains the largest fraction of the total variance, and so on. There exist a number of methods to determine the number of PC to be retained for a specific analysis. However, none of them uniformly dominates the others. Following a practice largely adopted in the field, we present the first 10 PC computed on this dataset.

This method allows for the separation of individuals on the basis of differences in their properties and can also be used to evaluate the properties that contribute the most to these separations. The principal components are ordered in terms of the amount of variation in the dataset that they explain such that the first PC explains the largest fraction of the total variance, and so on. There exist a number of methods to determine the number of PC to be retained for a specific analysis. However, none of them uniformly dominates the others.

	phv00076436.v1  	 " Principal component 4: a mathematical tool commonly used in statistical analysis. It seeks to identify an orthogonal coordinate system that transforms a number of possibly correlated variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables called principal components (PC). This method allows for the separation of individuals on the basis of differences in their properties and can also be used to evaluate the properties that contribute the most to these separations. The principal components are ordered in terms of the amount of variation in the dataset that they explain such that the first PC explains the largest fraction of the total variance, and so on. There exist a number of methods to determine the number of PC to be retained for a specific analysis. However, none of them uniformly dominates the others. Following a practice largely adopted in the field, we present the first 10 PC computed on this dataset.
