This method allows for the separation of individuals on the basis of differences in their properties and can also be used to evaluate the properties that contribute the most to these separations. The principal components are ordered in terms of the amount of variation in the dataset that they explain such that the first PC explains the largest fraction of the total variance, and so on. There exist a number of methods to determine the number of PC to be retained for a specific analysis. However, none of them uniformly dominates the others.
