phs000493.v1.p1::: Genetic Association Studies in the Solomon Islanders:::Study Description   The goal of this study was to determine the genetics underlying blond hair in the Solomon Islands, which has the highest prevalence of blondism outside of Europe. Participants in the study were of self-reported Solomon Islands ancestry and were 6-36 years of age at enrollment. Individuals with blond (N = 43) and dark hair (N = 42) were selected, approximately matched for age, sex and local geography, and spectrophometric measurements of hair pigmentation were made as a single measurement taken from hair at the crown. Individuals with gray, white, thin, bleached or artificially colored hair were excluded from analysis. All 85 participants were evaluated in a genome-wide scan to detected association to hair pigmentation in the Solomon Islands.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 0  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000266.v2.p1::: Skin Microbiome in Disease States: Atopic Dermatitis and Immunodeficiency:::Study Description   The NIH Intramural Skin Microbiome Consortium (NISMC) is a collaboration of investigators with primary expertise in genomics, bioinformatics, large-scale DNA sequencing, dermatology, immunology, allergy, infectious disease, and clinical microbiology. Atopic dermatitis (AD, "eczema") is a chronic relapsing skin disorder that affects ~15% of U.S. children and is associated with $1 billion of medical costs annually. AD is characterized by dry, itchy skin, infiltrated with immune cells. Colonization by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is ten-fold more common in AD patients and is associated with disease flares. We hypothesize that, in addition to S. aureus, AD may also be associated with additional novel microbes and/or selective shifts of commensal microbes that are relevant to disease progression. The NISMC seeks to define the microbiota that resides in and on the skin and nares of three patient groups, all of whom have eczematous lesions and are currently seen at the NIH Clinical Center: (1) AD patients; (2) Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) patients; and (3) Hyper IgE syndrome (HIES) patients. Examination of the microbiome of patients with WAS or HIES syndromes, both rare immunodeficiencies, will advance our understanding of how an individual's immune system shapes their cutaneous microbial community. We are performing a prospective longitudinal study that follows these groups of patient thorough the cycles of eczema flares, ascertaining clinical data and samples at each stage.    * Study Weblink: [RePORT: Project Information][1]    * Study Types: Longitudinal, Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 47  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=7968876&ic de=3248404  :::Longitudinal, Case-Control::: 47:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000409.v1.p1::: The Genomic Analysis of Medulloblastoma:::Study Description   Medulloblastoma is a heterogenous disease made up of at least four distinct subtypes of disease which appear to exploit and disrupt naturally occurring developmental pathways of cellular growth and hindbrain development. To better understand the driver mutations of this disease, we performed whole genome sequencing of 37 medulloblastomas and the corresponding normal DNA of the 37 affected children treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. We have found several novel mutations which appear subtype specific. These mutations were checked for frequency in a separate tumor cohort of 56 children with medulloblastoma, also treated on the St. Jude Medulloblastoma 2003 trial, and were tested in several animal models of medulloblastoma for proof of oncogenic potential.    * Study Types: Case Set, Whole Genome Sequencing, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 93  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set, Whole Genome Sequencing, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal::: 93:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000375.v1.p1::: Genome-Wide Association of Native and Post Aspirin Platelet Function Phenotypes:::Study Description   The goal of this study was to identify genetic variants in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that are associated with previously obtained platelet function phenotypes measured in each individual under baseline conditions and following 2 weeks of low dose aspirin (ASA). During this study we performed a high density 1 million-SNP genome scan on subjects from GeneSTAR (representing 800 2-generational families with a family history of premature coronary artery disease, 60% white and 40% African American, N=3232). We identified genomic loci associated with quantitative platelet phenotypes prioritized for their biological interest, determined associations between genomic loci and baseline platelet phenotypes (primary phenotypes are platelet aggregation in platelet rich plasma induced by collagen, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), arachidonic acid (AA), and epinephrine (Epi), determined associations between genomic loci and post-ASA platelet phenotypes, ie, measures of ASA "resistance" (primary phenotypes are as above, plus urinary levels of the prostaglandin metabolite, 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 ), and compared peaks of association between genomic loci and three common baseline platelet phenotypes (collagen-, epinephrine-, and ADP-induced aggregation in platelet rich plasma) with associations found for these same phenotypes in the Framingham Heart Study. We also determined whether any significant genotype-phenotype associations in the 1 million SNP genome scan could be localized to any specific genes or potential genes of interest using publicly available databases and further examined whether candidate genes previously associated with a specific platelet phenotype are located in a genomic region of interest as determined from the SNP genome scan. We conducted replications of our findings, and are presently involved in larger scale meta-analysis of findings for pre-aspirin and post-aspirin associations.  The study population is constituted of full siblings (SIBS) (ages 35-78 years) identified from The Johns Hopkins Sibling Study, now called GeneSTAR, the spouses of the SIBS, and their adult offspring (>21 years of age). They include 3200 individuals from approximately 300 African American and 500 white extended families. "Spouse" refers to the other parent of any SIB offspring, independent of marital status. Sibship sizes among families range from 1 to 16 (excluding index cases). On average, each SIB has 2 potentially eligible offspring. A family for this study is defined by all of the full sibships and the total numbers of offspring that come from all SIBS, rather than just the nuclear family.    * Study Weblink: [GeneSTAR][1]    * Study Types: Family, Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 0  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.genestarstudy.com/default.html  :::Family, Cohort::: 0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Families with a history of known premature coronary disease participated in a 2 week trial of platelet function prior to and following aspirin therapy, 81 mg/day. Platelet function was measured ex vivo, using various agonists and other measures, and DNA was banked. The first iteration of the genetic study of platelets was in PROGENI, and the study then proceeded on to STAMPEED.  The GeneSTAR GWAS study was carried out as planned under an award as part of STAMPEED (SNP Genotyping and Multiple Phenotyping in Existing Epidemiologic Databases). In the first year, a fully curated platelet function phenotype and family structure database and Data Dictionary were created. We used principal components analysis and components emerged that related closely to our biological hierarchy and explained nearly 80% of the variance in the overall phenotypes. We completed heritabilities, distributions, and associations among all platelet variables. Genotype-phenotype associations for each SNP were examined at Hopkins separately by race. The majority of our analyses were done at Washington University Division of Statistical Genetics (Province, MA) A locus on chromosome 1 (corresponding to the gene PEAR1) was analyzed by both groups and gave similar results.  In white subjects, we found 32 SNPs of genome-wide significance (< 5x10-8) for native platelet function phenotypes and 29 SNPs of genome-wide significance for post-ASA platelet phenotypes. For African Americans, the numbers of genome-wide significant associations were 32 for native platelet phenotypes and 28 for post-ASA phenotypes.  We tabulated SNPs in which there was a genome-wide significance level in one race, and replication at a nominal p value or better in the other race (p < 0.05), or SNPs in which the significance level in one race was < 10-11, with or without replication in the other .The most interesting associations occurred in PEAR1. PEAR1 (platelet endothelial aggregation receptor-1) is a platelet transmembrane receptor with unknown agonist, discovered in 2005, activated by platelet-platelet contact. In a recent candidate gene study, we found an association between a SNP in the promoter region of the PEAR1 gene with multiple native and post-ASA aggregation phenotypes in both whites and African Americans, This has been confirmed in the white Framingham Heart Study cohort (Johnson AD et al, Nature Genetics).  We completed a meta-analysis of native platelet aggregation phenotypes with the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort (Johnson A, Nature Genetics 42:608-613, 2010). We identified associations of seven loci with platelet aggregation in subjects of European ancestry. Evidence of replication was found for all loci in the African American cohort in GeneSTAR. In addition to these 7 loci, 15 other loci were identified in the meta-analysis as having association P values of 5.0x10-8<p<1.0x10-4 in the European ancestry cohort with P<0.05 in the African American cohort.  We have continued fine mapping and sequencing regions of interest, and are completing more work in replications with the HAPI Heart Study at the University of Maryland. Attempts to identify PEAR1 mRNA in platelet lysates were unsuccessful. PEAR1 appears to represent an important molecule in platelet aggregation and could represent an important new therapeutic target for drug development. The study is continuing to move toward a basic science explanation of the findings to date. Because of the nature of the original informed consent in PROGENI, we are submitting only aggregate data to dbGaP, with individual level data available via a special application process to the Principal Investigators at Johns Hopkins.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Lewis C.

phs000542.v1.p1::: Next Generation Mendelian Genetics: Neonatal Diabetes:::Study Description   The NHGRI Next Generation Mendelian Genetics project uses exome resequencing to identify variants in unsolved Mendelian diseases.  Neonatal diabetes mellitus (ND) is a rare form of monogenic diabetes (90,000-260,000 live births) that is diagnosed in the first 6 months of life. The disease has been classified as transient or permanent and although it can be inherited, more frequently is sporadic as a result of 'de novo' mutations. Defects in 12 genes have been found as responsible for the disease (defects in the paternally imprinted chromosomal region 6q24, IPF1, SLCA2A, INS, EIF2AK3, GCK, FOXP3, GLIS3, PTF1A, HNF1Beta, KCNJ11 and ABCC8). The two subunits of the ATP-sensitive K channel (ABCC8 and KCNJ11) and the insulin gene (INS), account for almost half of the cases and similar to CHI, the other half, remains genetically unexplained.  We became part of this study when we submitted 4 DNA samples for exome sequencing, from patients with NDM of Caucasian ancestry, which had no mutations identified in ABCC8 or KCNJ1, with the goal to identify new mutations in known genes or new mutations or genetic variants in new genes.    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 4  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set::: 4:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

We sequenced DNA from patients with several insulin secretory abnormalities, including Congenital Hyperinsulinism and Neonatal Diabetes. Understanding the mechanism by which mutations in the KATP channel subunits result in NDM, many of the patients have been treated with hypoglycemic agents instead of insulin injections. Four patients that had been sequenced for the frequent genes with no results were included in this study.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Lydia Aguilar-Bryan, MD, PhD.

The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.7 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project, a part of NHGRI's eMERGE network. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de- identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility.    * Study Weblink: [The eMERGE Network][5]    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 3021  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=NHGRI_DAC_Supplemental_Instruction.pdf     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000188.v1.p1     [3]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [4]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=eMERGE_Acknowledgement.pdf     [5]: https://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/victr/dcc/projects/acc/index.php/Main_Page  :::Case Set::: 3021:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000487.v1.p1::: Functionally Active Copy Number Variants Associated with Prostate Cancer Risk:::Study Description   Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in males throughout the world and has the largest estimated effect of heritability among the most common tumor types. Copy Number Variants (CNVs) are a recently recognized class of human germline polymorphisms (Iafrate AJ, et al. (2004) Nat Genet 36, 949-951; Sebat J, et al. (2004) Science 305, 525-528.) and are associated with a variety of human diseases, including cancer. This study characterized 1,903 individuals from the Tyrol Early Prostate Cancer Detection Program (Bartsch G, et al. (2008) BJU Int 101, 809-816) using a computational framework (Banerjee S, et al. (2011) PLoS One 29;6(3)). The study results establish non-coding and coding germline CNVs as significant risk factors for prostate cancer susceptibility and implicate their role in disease development and progression.

phs000220.v1.p1::: Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE): Multiethnic Cohort (MEC):::Study Description   The Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) has established a large biorepository of blood and urine (N=67,000) and cryopreserved lymphocytes (N=15,000) linked to extensive, prospectively collected risk factors (e.g., diet, smoking, physical activity), biomarkers and clinical data for five racial/ethnic groups. This cohort study of over 215,000 men and women in Hawaii and California is unique in that it is population-based and includes large representations of older adults (45-75 yrs at baseline) for five US racial/ethnic groups (Japanese Americans, African Americans, European Americans, Latinos and Native Hawaiians) at varying risks of chronic diseases. Within the PAGE investigation, the MEC proposes to study: 1) diseases for which we have DNA available for large numbers of cases and controls (breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, diabetes, and obesity); 2) important cancers that are less common (e.g., lung, pancreas, endometrial cancers, NHL) but for which we propose to pool our data with other funded groups; 3) common traits that are risk factors for these diseases (e.g., body mass index/weight, waist-to-hip ratio, height) and 4) relevant disease-associated biomarkers (e.g., fasting insulin and lipids, steroid hormones). The specific aims are: 1) To determine the population-based epidemiologic profile (allele frequency, main effect, heterogeneity by disease characteristics) of putative causal variants in the five racial/ethnic groups in the MEC; 2) for variants displaying effect heterogeneity across ethnic/racial groups, we will utilize differences in LD to identify a more complete spectrum of associated variants at these loci; 3) investigate gene x gene and gene x environment interactions to identify modifiers; 4) examine the associations of putative causal variants with already measured intermediate phenotypes (e.g., plasma insulin, lipids, steroid hormones); and 5) for variants that do not fall within known genes, start to investigate their relationships with gene expression and epigenetic patterns in small genomic studies.    * Study Weblink: [Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE)][1]    * Study Types: Cohort, Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 486  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.pagestudy.org  :::Cohort, Case-Control::: 486:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000345.v1.p1::: NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium Ulcerative Colitis Genome-Wide Association Study:::Study Description   This dataset contains data for 1,028 white, non-Hispanic, European ancestry individuals with ulcerative colitis who were included in a genome-wide association study published by Silverberg et al. (2009). These individuals were ascertained in North America and selected to have either left-sided or extensive disease (i.e., individuals with proctitis only were excluded). Genotyping was performed using the Illumina HumanHap300v2 (n = 540) and HumanHap550v3 (n = 488) Genotyping BeadChips at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research. Control data (not included) were obtained from the [NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium's Crohn's Disease GWAS][1] (available from dbGaP) and from studies 64 and 65 deposited in the Illumina iControlDB.  Seven hundred eighty individuals in this dataset were taken from the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium cell line repository ([http://www.niddkrepository.org][2]). These individuals are identified in the file dbGaP_SubjectDS.txt. The subject IDs for these individuals may be used to request corresponding samples for follow-up research through the repository. In addition, complete phenotype data for these individuals are included, collected using the Consortium's forms and phenotyping manual (both included). The remaining 248 individuals were identified from pre-existing collections ascertained by members of the Consortium or their collaborators. For these samples, several of the items in the phenotype file are incomplete.  Those who wish to replicate the results in Silverberg et al. should note that 6 individuals with missing genotype rates > 0.07 were excluded from that analysis (leaving 1,022 affected samples total). In addition, the minor allele frequencies (MAFs) reported in the publication were calculated using only those individuals who were included in the allelic association tests (n = 977 for SNPs included in the HumanHap300 and n = 476 for SNPs included only in the HumanHap550). These tests were performed using conditional logistic regression on gender-ancestry strata; individuals who were not placed in a stratum (using the procedure described in the supplementary information for Silverberg et al.) were excluded. The indicator variables hh300 and hh550 in the file dbGaP_PhenotypeDS.txt identify the samples included in the allelic association tests, and may be used to replicate the published MAFs among affected individuals.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1028  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./study.cgi?id=phs000130     [2]: http://www.niddkrepository.org  :::Case-Control::: 1028:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000421.v1.p1::: A Genome-Wide Association Study of Fuchs&#39; Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD):::Study Description   Fuchs' Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD) is a common disease that results in loss of vision associated with progressive corneal edema and loss of corneal transparency. In the initial stages of the disease, excrescences on Descemet's membrane with the appearance of an abnormal posterior collagenous layer, result in the clinical and pathologic appearance of guttae. Corneal edema ensues as endothelial function is compromised that may result in stromal edema, epithelial edema, and painful bullous keratopathy. Penetrating or endothelial keratoplasty is the only definitive treatment, with palliative care the only option prior to surgery. The pathophysiology underlying FECD, particularly in the common cases that affect older individuals, remains unknown, with a genetic predisposition being reported as the single best predictor of disease.  Three independent groups funded by the National Eye Institute (NEI), with well-established programs in the genetics of FECD, conducted a genome-wide association study of FECD. The collaboration comprised investigators from Case Western University (CWRU), Duke University (DUEC), and Johns Hopkins University (JHU). CWRU and DUEC contributed samples that were genotyped at CIDR for the GWAS. Johns Hopkins University (JHU) provided samples for the replication phase of the study, where their data are not listed in dbGaP. Cohorts of FECD cases and controls were assembled. Synchronization of clinical and coded data was performed to unify the information across centers. The family history, clinical, demographic information, and genome-wide genotype data for samples from CWRU and DUEC were deposited in dbGaP.    * Study Types: Case-Control, Family    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 4592  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control, Family::: 4592:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

The study involved the recruitment of probands, family members and unrelated controls from 29 sites throughout United States from the practices of private practice or university based cornea fellowship trained specialists. All sites underwent rigorous training on acquiring phenotypic disease severity for FECD using a modified grading scale of Krachmer and also detailed personal and family history pertinent to the disease. The probands were defined not only by the severity of the phenotype clinically, but also either by pathologic confirmation of the excised corneal tissue following keratoplasty or by enrolling additional severely affected siblings or avuncular relatives. Recruitment began in March 2005 and was concluded in December 2010.  Duke University initiated its study of FECD in 2002 and the team was granted an NIH award in 2007. The Duke dataset has over 1200 study subjects. Initially a linkage study was performed using 22 families (Afshari, et al., IOVS 2009). Since then the team has focused on both recruitment and genetic studies of FECD. A recent study with a combination of association and linkage studies (Li et al., 2011) was able to replicate TCF4 gene reported by Baratz et al. (2010). In our study, a set of 450 cases and 340 normal controls was used for association study, and revealed significant association with rs613872, the target marker of Baratz et al.(2010). In addition, the genome-wide linkage scan on 64 multiplex families composed primarily of affected sibling pairs (ASPs), a larger dataset than our first linkage scan, led to a promising linkage region localizing to chromosome 18 from 69.94cM to 85.29cM, with a peak multipoint HLOD = 2.5. The peak marker, rs1145315 (75.58cM) under the DOM model maps 1.5 Mb proximal to rs613872, which provides strong supporting evidence for the association finding at TCF4 marker. Both recruitment and genetic studies of FECD are still ongoing at Duke University Eye Center.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Natalie Afshari, MD.

phs000540.v1.p1::: Next Generation Mendelian Genetics: Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Type VIII:::Study Description   The NHGRI Next Generation Mendelian Genetics project uses exome resequencing to identify variants in unsolved Mendelian diseases.  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Type VIII is a dominantly inherited connective tissue disorder that is distinguished from other forms of EDS by significant early- onset periodontal disease. Although the clinical phenotype is well delineated, the underlying molecular basis remains unknown. By studying a large family of affected and unaffected individuals with the EDS VIII by exome sequencing, we hope to identify unique regions of homology to assist in identifying the causative gene.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 8  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 8:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000327.v1.p1::: NHLBI GO-ESP: Heart Cohorts Exome Sequencing Project (Siblings with Ischemic Stroke Study, SWISS):::Study Description   The NHLBI "Grand Opportunity" Exome Sequencing Project (GO-ESP), a signature project of the NHLBI Recovery Act investment, was designed to identify genetic variants in coding regions (exons) of the human genome (the "exome") that are associated with heart, lung and blood diseases. These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied. These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease, contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention and treatments to specific populations. This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects. GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers - BroadGO and SeattleGO.  The Siblings with Ischemic Stroke Study (SWISS) is an affected sibpair (ASP) study of patients and their brothers/sisters who have had similar strokes. The study was conducted to determine the genes that contribute to an individual's risk of developing an ischemic stroke (a stroke due to sudden interruption of blood flow to a part of the brain). Over 600 people have participated in SWISS, with the coordination of the recruitment and flow of the samples occurring at the Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, under the direction of James F. Meschia, MD. The University of Virginia (Stephen S. Rich, PhD) served as the analytic site for the genetic data. Participants were excluded from SWISS if they had stroke following an invasive cerebrovascular or cardiovascular procedure, if their stroke occurred shortly following an aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage, if the stroke occurred in the setting of a mechanical aortic or mitral valve, if the patient had definite CNS vasculitis or if the patient had a Mendelian mitochondrial stroke disorder, including CADASIL, MELAS, Fabry disease, sickle cell anemia or homocysteinemia.  For the NHLBI ESP, the youngest 51 ASPs (102 individuals) from SWISS were selected to undergo exome sequencing. These ASPs were selected from among all SWISS participants, excluding those pedigrees with individuals who had TOAST subtypes of stroke of other etiology or of stroke with undetermined etiology. In addition, the affected siblings were required to have the same TOAST subtype (both small vessel (lacunar) or both large vessel (atherosclerotic)). Of those selected, 98 samples passed initial quality control metrics, and 94 completed exome sequencing and were deposited in dbGaP.  An additional set of 590 samples from the SWISS collection has been genotyped on the ExomeChip that contained a subset of rare/infrequent variants identified by exome sequencing. These samples include 495 affected individuals (from multiple affected family members) as well as 95 unaffected family members. These genetic and phenotypic data also will reside in dbGaP.    * Study Weblink: [NHLBI GO-ESP Project][1]    * Study Types: Affected Sib Pairs, Exome Sequencing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 94  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://esp.gs.washington.edu/drupal/  :::Affected Sib Pairs, Exome Sequencing::: 94:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

To be enrolled as a concordant sibling, the subject must have a full sibling enrolled in SWISS. Both the case and concordant siblings must be at least 18 years old at enrollment and both must meet the same definition of ischemic stroke.

phs000264.v2.p1::: The Human Virome in Children and its Relationship to Febrile Illness:::Study Description   Definition of the human microbiome is an important scientific priority. This study will expand the scope of the investigation to include viruses, which account for a substantial proportion of infectious disease morbidity and mortality, especially in children. The long-term goal of this project is to describe the human virome in children and to investigate its relevance to febrile illnesses in children. The project will also seek to understand the relationship of the immune system to the composition of the virome. Thus, the project's specific aims are 1) To elucidate the spectrum of viruses that can be detected using non-biased, high throughput sequencing on samples of blood, respiratory, and gastrointestinal secretions from healthy children and to use this information as a basis for understanding the role of viruses in acute febrile illnesses without an obvious source, and 2) to investigate the effect of various forms of immunosuppression on the spectrum of viruses detected in children, and to use this information as a basis for understanding the role of viruses in acute febrile illnesses occurring in these children. Our preliminary studies show that diverse viruses can be detected in children having undiagnosed fever. To carry out the specific aims, well children will be enrolled prior to having elective surgery, and febrile otherwise well children will be enrolled from the Emergency Department at St. Louis Children's Hospital. Immunocompromised children will be recruited from hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplant clinics, the HIV/AIDS clinic, and the rheumatology/immunology clinic from the same hospital. Children with fever will have samples obtained at the time of the febrile illness and at 1 and 6-month follow-up visits. Selected samples from each study group will be analyzed at the Genome Center at Washington University (GCWU) using next generation 454 high throughput sequencing to detect and sequence all viral sequences present. We anticipate detecting and sequencing a broad range of viruses, including previously unrecognized agents. A variety of techniques will be used to investigate the significance of viruses detected. Virus-specific PCR assays will be used to determine the frequency and extent of viruses detected by sequencing, using the full range of samples collected. Host response to the detected viruses will be investigated using serologic analysis, cytokine profiling, and microarrays to characterize host gene expression. These studies will take advantage of follow-up samples to compare the acute response with the response in the convalescent period. This study will draw upon the expertise and technological assets of one of the world's most powerful sequencing centers to provide the research community with a comprehensive sequence data base of the viruses that are present in children, which can be used to improve our understanding of the causes of febrile illnesses in young children, many of which are currently undiagnosed.    * Study Type: Prospective    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 183  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Prospective::: 183:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000454.v1.p1::: Genome-Wide Association Study of HIV-1 Host Genetics Among Injection Drug Users:::Study Description   The overarching goal of this project is to identify and characterize genetic determinants of HIV 1 susceptibility and resistance in samples of African American (AA) and European American (EA) injection drug users (IDUs) by conducting (1) a case/control genome-wide association (GWA) study of HIV 1 infection (positive/negative); (2) a case-only GWA study of viral load among HIV+ IDUs. The study uses existing samples and data from Urban Health Study (UHS) (PI: Alex Kral), which was the longest-running study of street-recruited IDUs in North America, from 1986-2005. UHS was a serial, cross-sectional sero- epidemiological study. Data were collected every 6 months in communities with a high prevalence of injection drug use in the San Francisco Bay Area. It used targeted sampling in neighborhoods at easily accessible community field sites, such as churches, single room occupancy hotels, and community centers. Eligibility criteria for initial entry to the study were (1) injection drug use in past 30 days; (2) ability to provide informed consent; and (3) age 18 or older. The UHS cohort includes over 9,000 African American and European American IDUs whose serum samples have been stored and data are available on HIV antibody status, HIV risk behaviors, drug abuse and demographics.  The current study includes 984 HIV+ cases and 2,243 HIV- controls. Approximately two HIV- controls per case were frequency matched on: (1) self- reported ancestry; (2) sex; (3) age; (4) year of ascertainment; and (5) HIV risk class. This GWAS (DA026141) was funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA; PI: Eric O. Johnson). Funding support for genotyping, which was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR), was provided by NIDA and the NIH contract "High throughput genotyping for studying the genetic contributions to human disease"(HHSN268200782096C).    * Study Weblink: [RTI][1]    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 3227  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.rti.org  :::Case-Control::: 3227:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000368.v1.p1::: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Genetics:::Study Description   **PCOS** is a complex genetic disease reflecting the interplay of susceptibility genes and environmental factors. The cardinal reproductive feature of the syndrome, hyperandrogenemia, appears to play a direct role in the pathogenesis of the associated metabolic abnormalities. Male as well as female first-degree relatives have reproductive and metabolic phenotypes including increased prevalence rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D), metabolic syndrome (MBS) and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Northwestern University (NU) investigators lead a team that has extensive experience in phenotyping PCOS and in the genetic analysis of complex diseases including genome-wide association study (GWAS). Together with an expert group of collaborators from the Hershey Medical Center, and The University of Chicago, we have conducted a GWAS to identify PCOS susceptibility alleles using a large cohort of extensively and consistently phenotyped PCOS cases. Population controls for this study come from the NUgene project described below.  **NUgene project**: In 2002, Northwestern committed to the development of a DNA repository to serve as a platform for the identification and validation of genotype-phenotype associations that will impact healthcare. The NUgene Project is a repository with longitudinal medical information from participating patients at affiliated hospitals and outpatient clinics from the Northwestern University Medical Center. Participants' DNA samples are coupled with data from a questionnaire (2 versions were used, 1 before and 1 after February 2006, both are included) and continuously updated data from our Electronic Medical Record (EMR) representing actual clinical care events.

phs000200.v8.p2::: Women&#39;s Health Initiative Clinical Trial and Observational Study:::Study Description   ** Important Links and Information **    * [Data Use Certification Agreement][1]    * [Apply for Authorized Access ][2]    * [Acknowledgement Statements][3]  The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) is a long-term national health study that has focused on strategies for preventing heart disease, breast and colorectal cancer, and osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women. The original WHI study included 161,808 postmenopausal women enrolled between 1993 and 1998. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA serves as the WHI Clinical Coordinating Center for data collection, management, and analysis of the WHI.  The WHI has two major parts: a partial factorial randomized Clinical Trial (CT) and an Observational Study (OS); both were conducted at 40 Clinical Centers nationwide.  The CT enrolled 68,132 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50-79 into trials testing three prevention strategies. If eligible, women could choose to enroll in one, two, or all three of the trial components. The components are:    * **Hormone Therapy Trials (HT)**: This double-blind component examined the effects of combined hormones or estrogen alone on the prevention of coronary heart disease and osteoporotic fractures, and associated risk for breast cancer. Women participating in this component with an intact uterus were randomized to estrogen plus progestin (conjugated equine estrogens [CEE], 0.625 mg/d plus medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA] 2.5 mg/d] or a matching placebo. Women with prior hysterectomy were randomized to CEE or placebo. Both trials were stopped early, in July 2002 and March 2004, respectively, based on adverse effects. All HT participants continued to be followed without intervention until close-out.    * **Dietary Modification Trial (DM)**: The Dietary Modification component evaluated the effect of a low-fat and high fruit, vegetable and grain diet on the prevention of breast and colorectal cancers and coronary heart disease. Study participants were randomized to either their usual eating pattern or a low-fat dietary pattern.    * **Calcium/Vitamin D Trial (CaD)**: This double-blind component began 1 to 2 years after a woman joined one or both of the other clinical trial components. It evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. Women in this component were randomized to calcium (1000 mg/d) and vitamin D (400 IU/d) supplements or a matching placebo.  The **Observational Study (OS)** examines the relationship between lifestyle, environmental, medical and molecular risk factors and specific measures of health or disease outcomes. This component involves tracking the medical history and health habits of 93,676 women not participating in the CT. Recruitment for the observational study was completed in 1998 and participants were followed annually for 8 to 12 years.  The original protocol allowed for follow-up until March 2005, after which participants were invited to enroll in the first WHI Extension Study for follow-up through 2010. Participants were invited again to participate in the second WHI Extension Study with continued follow up from 2010 to 2015. As of March 31, 2011 there were 93,122 women enrolled in the second extension. As part of the second Extension, 80+ year old women were asked to consent to an In Person Visit at their homes during which additional blood samples were collected and various measurements were taken (such as blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference, grip strength, etc).  **The WHI Cohort is utilized in the following dbGaP substudies.** To view genotypes, analysis, expression data, other molecular data, and derived variables collected in these substudies, please click on the following substudies below or in the "Substudies" box located on the right hand side of this top-level study page phs000200 WHI Cohort.    * [phs000386][4] WHI SHARe    * [phs000281][5] GO-ESP WHISP    * [phs000315][6] WHI GARNET    * [phs000503][7] WHISE    * [phs000227][8] PAGE WHI    * Study Weblinks: [Scientific Resources Website: Women's Health Initiative][9]; [NHLBI Women's Health Initiative][10]    * Study Types: Partial Factorial Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo- Controlled, Cohort, Longitudinal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 55181  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000200.v8.p2     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [3]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=WHIAcknowledgement.pdf     [4]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000386     [5]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000281     [6]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000315     [7]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000503     [8]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000227     [9]: http://www.whiscience.org     [10]: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/whi  :::Partial Factorial Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Cohort, Longitudinal::: 55181:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000414.v1.p1::: Whole genome sequencing of core-binding factor leukemia:::Study Description   Pediatric _de novo_ acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease that can be divided into clinically distinct subtypes based on the presence of specific chromosomal abnormalities or gene alterations. One of the best characterized subtypes of AML involves leukemias with alterations of the core- binding factor (CBF)-complex, which comprises the FAB subtypes M2 and M4Eo and associates with a favorable outcome. Patients with the AML M2 subtype harbor a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 21 [t(8;21)] that yields the chimeric fusion gene _RUNX1(AML1)-RUNX1T1(ETO)_, while patients with AML M4Eo express the chimeric fusion gene _CBF-SMMHC(MYH11)_ as a result of an inversion/translocation event of chromosome 16 [inv(16)/t(16;16)]. In an effort to define the total complement of genetic changes in CBF-leukemia, we performed paired-end whole genome sequencing (WGS) on diagnostic leukemia blasts and matched germ line samples from 17 pediatric CBF-leukemia patients using the Illumina platform. Somatic alterations, including single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and structural variations (SVs), including insertions, deletions, inversions, and inter- and intra-chromosomal rearrangements, were detected using complementary analysis pipelines (Bambino, CREST and CONSERTING). Recurrent screening of identified mutations will be performed in a cohort of approximately 94 cases of CBF-leukemias.    * Study Types: Case Set, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal, Whole Genome Sequencing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 17  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal, Whole Genome Sequencing::: 17:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000445.v1.p1::: Genome Variation among HIV-Resistant People with Hemophilia:::Study Description   Rare individuals are highly resistant to infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Studies of candidate genes resulted in the discovery of a 32bp deletion in the CC-chemokine receptor 5 gene (CCR532), which rendered this critical co-receptor for primary HIV infection to be non-functional. Pharmacologic and vaccine-induced blockade of CCR5 is being pursued to treat and prevent HIV infection and other conditions.  The allele frequency of CCR532 among persons of European ancestry is approximately 10%. CCR532/32 homozygotes are almost totally resistant to HIV infection. People with severe hemophilia A require frequent replacement with clotting Factor VIII (FVIII) to control hemorrhage. Prior to the discovery of HIV in 1984 and licensure of recombinant FVIII in the late 1980s, people with severe hemophilia A were treated with plasma-derived FVIII and thus were intensively exposed to HIV. Only 5% of such patients were not infected with HIV. Of these, approximately 1/3 were CCR532/32 homozygotes. The remaining 2/3 of these people who were highly resistant to HIV remain unexplained. This project seeks to discover genome variations among people who are highly resistant to HIV infection. Such variation is likely to serve as a target for reducing the morbidity and incidence of HIV.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 20  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 20:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000004.v1.p1::: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Repository Neurologically Normal Control Collection:::Study Description   The NINDS repository [(http://ccr.coriell.org/ninds/)][1] was established in October 2001 with the goal of developing standardized, broadly useful diagnostic and other clinical data, as well as a collection of DNA and cell line samples to further advance gene discovery of neurological disorders. All samples and both phenotypic and genotypic data are available to the research community including academic and industry scientists. A set of samples from individuals who do not have neurological disease was felt to be essential to allow gene discovery in neurological disorders to proceed. Towards this goal, the NINDS has and is collecting samples and phenotypic data on neurologically normal individuals. The data being collected includes demographic, ethnic, and exclusion of neurological disease information. Variables were measured using the [Control Clinical Data Elements form][2]. As of June 2007, there are a total of 2157 publicly available and an additional >2000 which will be added to the publicly available biomaterials collection shortly.  Blood samples were drawn from neurologically normal, unrelated, individuals at many different sites. Spouses, convenience controls, and population controls were all included in this collection. Each participant underwent a detailed medical history interview and had no family history on specific query of Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ataxia, autism, bipolar disorder, brain aneurysm, dementia, dystonia, or Parkinson's disease. Folstein Mini-mental state examination scores ranged from 26-30 and are available on a subset of individuals. All participants were interviewed for family history in detail and specifically had no first degree relative with any of the following: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ataxia, autism, brain aneurysm, dystonia, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia.  A subset of neurologically normal control subjects was utilized in [NINDS Parkinson's Disease][3], [NINDS Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Controls][4] and [NINDS Ischemic Stroke Genetics Study (ISGS)][5].    * Study Weblink: [NINDS, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke][6]    * Study Type: Control Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 2723  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://ccr.coriell.org/ninds     [2]: javascript:getPage('document.cgi', 43);     [3]: ./study.cgi?id=phs000089     [4]: ./study.cgi?id=phs000101     [5]: ./study.cgi?id=phs000102     [6]: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/  :::Control Set::: 2723:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **UPDATE**  Summary level data for this study has been updated since its initial release at dbGaP.

The repository has added Mini mental status (MMSE) score to the controls CDE.    2. The NINDS Human Genetics Resource Center does not accept unaffected blood relatives of an affected individual unless:      * They are approved as part of a special collection, per the project officer (such as a funded discordant sib pair study, a funded triad study, etc, that has already been approved).      * They are part of a pedigree with three or more living affected individuals which have been or will be collected (notify the project officer in advance for such circumstances so that we do not reject them in error).    3. We will not accept as controls any individuals who themselves, or whose first degree relatives, have stroke, epilepsy, Parkinsons, or dementia, as this will prohibit our pooling of controls with other NIH collections. In some cases, those with related disorders to one of our collections may also be excluded (for example, a person with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or carotid stenosis would not be considered a good control for Parkinson's, since, stroke is one of our target collections; likewise, a subject with a parent or sibling with Alzheimer's disease (AD) would not be a good control, since we are collecting Parkinsons and ALS which may have a biological relationship to AD).    4. If you are using subjects with a neurological disorder such as stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson's, as controls for your particular study, please do not fill out the control CDEs for that submission, but fill out the correct disease CDE for that disorder. That will allow us to accept them in most circumstances.    5. Controls without CDEs completed will not be accepted.  ::: ::: ::: :::Study Attribution     * ** Investigators who have submitted Neurologically Normal Control Samples and Data to the NINDS Repository to Date (July 2007).

The primary outcome in the study was lung growth, as assessed by the change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1, expressed as a percentage of the predicted value) after the administration of a bronchodilator. Secondary outcomes included the degree of airway responsiveness, morbidity, physical growth, and psychological development.  **CARE: **The Childhood Asthma Research and Education (CARE) Network was established in 1999 by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Five clinical centers and a data coordinating center were selected to participate in this research network. Since asthma is the most common chronic childhood disease in the U.S., the CARE Network was established to evaluate treatments for children with asthma, conducting studies for children with asthma and sharing their findings with the health care community.  **ACRN: **The Asthma Clinical Research Network (ACRN) was established in 1993 by the Division of Lung Diseases (DLD), National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). The objectives of this multi-center program are to conduct multiple well designed clinical trials for rapid evaluation of new and existing therapeutic approaches to asthma and to disseminate laboratory and clinical findings to the health care community. From 1993 to 2003, ACRN consisted of six Clinical Centers and one Data Coordinating Center (DCC). In September 2003, after a national competition, NHLBI re-awarded ACRN for another 5 years with eight Clinical Centers and one DCC to continue pursuit of the same objectives.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Steering Committee Chairs **      * James Kiley, PhD.

phs000426.v1.p1::: SLCO1B1 Variants and Methotrexate Clearance:::Study Description   Methotrexate plasma concentration is related to its clinical effects. To identify the genetic basis of interindividual variability in methotrexate pharmacokinetics in children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we performed a genome-wide analysis (GWAS) of 500,568 germline single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 434 children with ALL who received 3,014 courses of methotrexate at 2 to 5 g/m2. SNPs were validated in an independent cohort of 206 patients. Adjusting for age, race, sex, and methotrexate regimen, the most significant associations were with SNPs in the organic anion transporter polypeptide, _SLCO1B1_ (rs11045879 (P = 1.7 x 10-10) and rs4149081 (P = 1.7 x 10-9) (Trevino et al, PMID: [19901119][1]). To test whether rare variants in _SLCO1B1_ could alter its function, we genotyped _SLCO1B1_ exons in a slightly larger group of 699 children with ALL who received methotrexate and identified 93 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We found several common and rare non-synonymous (NS) SNPs associated with methotrexate clearance.  NS SNPs predicted to be functionally damaging (common or rare) were more likely to be found among patients with the lowest adjusted methotrexate clearance (lowest 10%) than patients with high clearance (highest 10%). Four _SLCO1B1_ haplotypes were associated with reduced methotrexate clearance and we verified that these haplotypes have lower function with in vitro transport assays. We were able to quantitatively account for a third of the population variability in clearance of methotrexate with clinical and genetic covariates. This data set includes the dependent variable of methotrexate clearance and all of the SNP data available from arrays, sequencing, and genotyping.    * Study Type: Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 673  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19901119  :::Cohort::: 673:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000451.v1.p1::: NHLBI and NIA The New England Centenarian Study (NECS):::Study Description   Supercentenarians (age 110+ years old) generally delay or escape age-related diseases and disability well beyond the age one hundred and this exceptional survival is likely to be influenced by a genetic predisposition that includes both common and rare genetic variants. In this report, we describe the complete genomic sequences of male and female supercentenarians, both age >114 years old. We show that: (1) the sequence variant spectrum of these two individuals' DNA sequences is largely comparable to existing non- supercentenarian genomes; (2) the two individuals do not appear to carry most of the well-established human longevity enabling variants already reported in the literature; (3) they have a comparable number of known disease-associated variants relative to most human genomes sequenced to date; (4) approximately 1% of the variants these individuals possess are novel and may point to new genes involved in exceptional longevity; and (5) both individuals are enriched for longevity-associated variants that we discovered through a large genome- wide association study. These analyses suggest that there are both common and rare longevity associated variants that may counter the effects of disease predisposing variants and extend lifespan. The continued analysis of the genomes of these rare individuals who have survived to extremely old ages should provide insight into the processes that contribute to the maintenance of health during extreme ageing.    * Study Weblink: [New England Centenarian Study][1]    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 2  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.bumc.bu.edu/centenarian  :::Case Set::: 2:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

In 2000 enrollment was expanded to include centenarians from throughout the United States ([www.bumc.bu.edu/centenarian][1]). Potential participants were identified from state voter registries, responses to nursing home and senior center mailings, news items appearing in print and on the World Wide Web, and enrollment inquiries made directly to the NECS. The only exclusion criterion for the NECS has been the inability to validate age. Age validation is based on birth certificate, when available, U.S. census data and family history reconstruction. As it became apparent to several studies (the NECS, the Japanese Centenarian Study and the University of Southern Denmark) that the power to discover genetic variants associated with exceptional longevity increased with older and older ages of centenarians, in approximately 2008, the NECS began to emphasize subjects age 105+ years in its recruitment efforts. As of August, 2012, the NECS has >400 subjects age 105-109 years and ~120 subjects age 110+ years in its sample. All subjects are enrolled in studies approved and overseen by the Boston University Medical Campus Institutional Review Board.

phs000304.v1.p1::: Genes and Blood Clotting Study (GABC):::Study Description   **Objectives:** Use genome-wide approaches to identify genetic variants that influence common thrombosis and hemostasis factors, as well as selected common human traits.  **Design/Methods:** The GABC study was a prospective sibling cohort design. Siblings were recruited by targeted email to the undergraduate and graduate student email lists at the University of Michigan. Healthy persons between 14 and 35 years old who had healthy siblings within the same age restriction were able to participate. Study participants agreed to an online informed consent and subsequently completed a 52-question online survey describing their specific bleeding traits as well as many common human traits. Fifty milliliters of blood was collected into a citrate-dextrose solution (ACD) from each participant. An aliquot of whole blood was used for an automated complete blood count analysis and the remainder was processed into platelet poor plasma and buffy coat portions. Plasma and buffy coat aliquots were snap frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen for future studies. 1189 individuals representing 507 sibships were collected between 06/26/2006 and 01/30/2009.  **Phenotyping Survey Details:** To characterize individual bruising and bleeding history, the online survey recorded answers to questions based on a modified von Willebrand Disease (VWD) screening questionnaire. To characterize a collection of participant's common human traits, the survey recorded answers to questions about height, weight, presence of skin tags, history of acne, eye color, hair color, hair line characteristics, skin sunburn sensitivity, skin tanning ability, natural skin color, freckling, cheek dimpling, earlobe shape, shoe size, foot arch characteristics, hand fifth digit morphology, history of dyslexia, history of migraine headaches, history of seasonal allergies, history of apthous ulcers, tendency to sneeze while walking into a bright sunny place, history of dental caries, need for corrective eye lenses, handedness and like or dislike of strongly flavored foods. **Biochemical phenotyping:** Assays for plasma Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) antigen were performed using ELISA and "Alphalisa" techniques. Automated complete blood count analysis was performed on a Bayer Advia 120 on all participants (including WBC differential, RBC indices, and platelet count.) **Genotyping Details:** SNP genotyping was performed using genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood at the Broad Institute, (MIT/Harvard). Genotyping was performed on the Illumina Omni-1 quad chip at the Broad Institute.  This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [http://www.genevastudy.org][1]) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to blood clotting through large-scale genome-wide association studies of siblings. Genotyping was performed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, a GENEVA genotyping center. Data cleaning and harmonization was performed by the primary investigators at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.  This study serves as a resource for investigators who are interested in the genetic determinants of specific plasma proteins in a healthy population. The sibling cohort design allows for linkage analysis in addition to association studies. Analysis of thrombosis and hemostasis related traits should help elucidate specific biochemical and genetic networks that maintain hemostasis. We hope to identify specific genetic determinants of VWF levels in order to better understand the factors that influence the development of VWD.    * Study Weblink: [Genes and Blood Clotting][2]    * Study Type: Sibling Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1179  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.genevastudy.org     [2]: http://blood-demo.lsi.umich.edu/home/index.php  :::Sibling Cohort::: 1179:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000183.v1.p1::: Genome-wide association study of primary biliary cirrhosis:::Study Description   Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic destructive granulomatous cholangitis, characteristically associated with anti-mitochondrial antibodies. Twin and family aggregation data suggest significant genetic predisposition, but the susceptibility loci for PBC are unknown. To identify genetic loci conferring risk for PBC, we carried out a genomewide association (GWA) analysis in which 2072 North American subjects (536 PBC cases; 1536 controls) were genotyped for over 300,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Sixteen of the most strongly associated SNPs were genotyped in two independent replication sets (US based: 410 PBC cases; 310 controls and Canada based: 116 cases; 896 controls). Fine-mapping studies across three PBC-associated loci were also performed in 1900 Canada based subjects (621 cases; 1279 controls).  Modified from [Hirschfield et al][1].

Participants are randomized to either a screening or control arm. Each year after enrollment, subjects are asked to notify the study of any cancers diagnosed in the past year using the Annual Study Update (ASU).  The trial is designed to test the efficacy of cancer screening to prevent early death from prostate, lung, colorectal and ovarian cancer. The collection of questionnaire data and biospecimens (e.g., repeated blood samples and in some instances, buccal cell samples) allows investigation of early markers for cancer as well as etiology of common cancers.  PLCO enrollment began in 1993 and ended in 2001. Recruitment included men and women, aged 55 to 74 with no reported history of prostate, lung, colon and ovarian cancer, although prior diagnoses of other cancers were acceptable.  The CGEMS cohort consisted of men enrolled in the screening arm of the PLCO Trial who:  > <ol> <li>were White and non-Hispanics;<li>  * had no prior history of prostate of cancer before randomization;  * had at least one PLCO prostate cancer screen (PSA) before October 1, 2003;  * had completed a Baseline Questionnaire about risk factors for cancer;  * had signed informed consent;  * had provided a blood sample with    1. at least 11 g DNA    2. at least 1 vial of buffy coat, or    3. at least 7 vials of whole blood was available; _and_  * for controls, had returned at least one Annual Study Update (ASU).  Based on these criteria, 28,521 men were included in the CGEMS sub-cohort.  CGEMS distinguishes between non-aggressive and aggressive cases of prostate cancer at the time of diagnosis. The two subtypes are defined as follows:  > <ol> <li><i><b>Non-aggressive<b>_: cases with a Gleason Score < 7 and Stage < III.  * _**Aggressive**_: cases with a Gleason Sore  7 or Stage  III.  Study enrollment began on October 1, 1993. Consequently, study years in the PLCO Trial are counted according to the Federal fiscal year, Oct 1 to the next September 30.  All men diagnosed with prostate cancer between enrollment and the end of FY2001 were considered for inclusion in CGEMS. Because of our interest in the clinically more significant, but less common aggressive form of prostate cancer, we increased the fraction of aggressive cases in the CGEMS case series by extending eligibility for cases diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer through the end of FY2003.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Lead Principal Investigator **      * Stephen J.

phs000476.v1.p1::: Molecular defects in pseudohypoparathyroidism or related disorders:::Study Description   Maintaining calcium levels within a narrow normal range is of critical importance for numerous different cellular functions. One of the most important regulators of blood calcium levels is parathyroid hormone (PTH), which mediates its actions through the PTH/PTHrP receptor, a Gs-coupled receptor. Few inherited disorders are characterized by diminished blood calcium levels and elevated blood phosphate levels; some of these disorders are caused by too little PTH synthesis and/or secretion (hypoparathyroidism, HP), while others are caused by resistance towards PTH (pseudohypoparathyroidism, PHP). Only few of the inherited forms of HP (<10%) have been defined at the molecular level. In contrast, genetic mutations have been identified for several inherited forms of PHP. For example, PHP type Ia (PHP-Ia) is caused by maternally inherited mutations in those GNAS exons that encode Gs, while autosomal dominant PHP type Ib (AD-PHP-Ib) is caused by maternal inherited deletions within or up-stream of GNAS, which are associated with abnormal GNAS methylation. However, a large number of patients with PTH- resistance and thus hypocalcemia show GNAS methylation changes, but their underlying genetic defects have not yet been defined at the DNA level. These "sporadic" patients may be affected by an autosomal recessive form of PHP-Ib (AR-PHP-Ib), which is most likely not linked to the GNAS locus. In our studies, we propose to search through exome sequence analyses for novel genetic mutations responsible for novel autosomal dominant forms of HP that are not caused by mutations in the known disease-causing genes; some of these families are large enough to perform genetic linkage studies. We furthermore propose to search for the genetic mutation(s) responsible for the autosomal recessive variant of PHP-Ib through the analysis of whole exome sequences; for these studies we focus particularly on patients, whose parents are likely to be consanguineous. The proposed efforts are expected to lead to the identification of novel genes that are involved in parathyroid development and function (HP) and genes that are involved in the establishment or maintenance of GNAS methylation (AR-PHP-Ib).    * Study Types: Probands, Mendelian, Family    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 20  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Probands, Mendelian, Family::: 20:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000252.v2.p1::: Diet, Genetic Factors, and the Gut Microbiome in Crohn&#39;s Disease:::Study Description   We investigate the hypothesis that consistent changes in the human gut microbiome are associated with Crohn's disease, a form of inflammatory bowel disease, and that altered microbiota contributes to pathogenesis. Analysis of this problem is greatly complicated by the fact that multiple factors influence the composition of the gut microbiota, including diet, host genotype, and disease state. For example, data from us and others document a drastic impact of diet on the composition of the gut microbiome. No amount of sequencing will yield a useful picture of the role of the microbiota in disease if samples are confounded with uncontrolled variables.  We aim to characterize the composition of the gut microbiome while controlling for diet, host genotype, and disease state. Diet is controlled by analyzing children treated for Crohn's disease by placing them on a standardized elemental diet, and by testing effects of different diets on the gut microbiome composition in adult volunteers. Genotype is analyzed by large scale SNP genotyping, which is already underway and separately funded--team member Hakon Hakonarson is currently genotyping 50 children a week at ~half a million loci each and investigating connections with inflammatory bowel disease. Clinical status is ascertained in the very large IBD practice in the UPenn/CHOP hospital system. Effects of diet, host genotype, and disease state on the gut microbiome are summarized in a multivariate model, allowing connections between microbiome and disease to be assessed free of confounding factors.  This project is divided into four sub-studies. In the Fecal Storage Methods (FSM) study, methods of stool storage and DNA extraction are compared to examine their impact on DNA sequence analysis results. The Controlled Feeding Experiment (CaFE) addresses the effects of controlled diets on the gut microbiome. In the Cross-sectional Study of Diet and Stool Microbiome Composition (COMBO), the effects of diet analyzed using surveys and deep sequencing of stool specimens. The fourth study, Pediatric Longitudinal Study of Elemental Diet and Stool Microbiome Composition (PLEASE), examines the effects of an elemental diet treatment on pediatric patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly Crohn's disease.    * Fecal Storage Methods (FSM): Cross-sectional study    * Controlled Feeding Experiment (CaFE): Controlled trial    * Cross-sectional Study of Diet and Stool Microbiome Composition (COMBO): Cross-sectional study    * Pediatric Longitudinal Study of Elemental Diet and Stool Microbiome Composition (PLEASE): Longitudinal cohort study    * Study Types: Cross-Sectional, Controlled Trial, Longitudinal Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 128  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Cross-Sectional, Controlled Trial, Longitudinal Cohort::: 128:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000240.v1.p1::: National Eye Institute (NEI) Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS):::Study Description   The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) is an National Eye Institute- sponsored multi-center, randomized, prospective treatment trial designed to determine whether lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in individuals with ocular hypertension delays or prevents the development of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). A total of 1,636 individuals with ocular hypertension between 40 and 80 years old were enrolled in the study. In addition to ocular hypertension, subjects in the OHTS were required to have normal optic nerve appearance as determined by the OHTS Optic Disc Reading Center and normal and reliable visual field tests at the time of enrollment by the OHTS Visual Field Reading Center. OHTS subjects were randomly assigned to either an observational group which received close observation or a topical medication group which received medication as needed to achieve a 20% reduction in IOP from their baseline levels. Subjects then were examined at regular intervals for optic disc cupping or visual field defects. Other clinical measures were also obtained from OHTS subjects including central corneal thickness (CCT) and intraocular pressure. The primary outcome monitored for the OHTS was the development of glaucoma in one or both eyes as defined by reproducible visual field abnormality or reproducible optic disc deterioration attributed to POAG by the masked OHTS Endpoint Committee. The OHTS study design has been reported in detail (Gordon, 1999; PMID: [10326953][1]).  The OHTS confirmed that ocular hypertension is a risk factor for developing POAG and showed that lowering IOP reduced the risk for developing POAG (Kass, 2002; PMID: [12049574][2]). The OHTS also demonstrated that thin CCT is a significant risk factor for the development of POAG (Gordon, 2002; PMID: [12049575][3]).  Blood samples were also collected from 1,077 OHTS participants for an ancillary genetics study. DNA was prepared from these samples and used in a genome-wide association scan (GWAS) designed to identify genetic factors that control the magnitude of quantitative features of glaucoma (baseline IOP, baseline cup-to-disc ratio, and CCT). Genotypes from the GWAS and these clinical data (IOP, cup-to-disc ratio, and CCT) have been provided to dbGaP.    * Study Type: Clinical Trial    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1063  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10326953     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12049574     [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12049575  :::Clinical Trial::: 1063:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

In 1948, the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) -- under the direction of the National Heart Institute (now known as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI) -- embarked on a novel and ambitious project in health research. At the time, little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke, but the death rates for CVD had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the century and had become an American epidemic.  The objective of the FHS was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke.  **Design of Framingham Heart Study.** In 1948, the researchers recruited 5,209 men and women between the ages of 30 and 62 from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts, and began the first round of extensive physical examinations and lifestyle interviews that they would later analyze for common patterns related to CVD development. Since 1948, the subjects have returned to the study every two years for an examination consisting of a detailed medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, and in 1971, the study enrolled a second-generation cohort -- 5,124 of the original participants' adult children and their spouses -- to participate in similar examinations. The second examination of the Offspring cohort occurred eight years after the first examination, and subsequent examinations have occurred approximately every four years thereafter. In April 2002 the Study entered a new phase: the enrollment of a third generation of participants, the grandchildren of the original cohort. The first examination of the Third Generation Study was completed in July 2005 and involved 4,095 participants. Thus, the FHS has evolved into a prospective, community-based, three generation family study. The FHS is a joint project of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and Boston University.  **Research Areas in the Framingham Heart Study.** Over the years, careful monitoring of the FHS population has led to the identification of the major CVD risk factors -- high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and physical inactivity -- as well as a great deal of valuable information on the effects of related factors such as blood triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels, age, gender, and psychosocial issues. Risk factors have been identified for the major components of CVD, including coronary heart disease, stroke, intermittent claudication, and heart failure. It is also clear from research in the FHS and other studies that substantial subclinical vascular disease occurs in the blood vessels, heart and brain that precedes clinical CVD. With recent advances in technology, the FHS has enhanced its research capabilities and capitalized on its inherent resources by the conduct of high resolution imaging to detect and quantify subclinical vascular disease in the major blood vessels, heart and brain. These studies have included ultrasound studies of the heart (echocardiography) and carotid arteries, computed tomography studies of the heart and aorta, and magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain, heart, and aorta. Although the Framingham cohort is primarily white, the importance of the major CVD risk factors identified in this group have been shown in other studies to apply almost universally among racial and ethnic groups, even though the patterns of distribution may vary from group to group. In the past half century, the Study has produced approximately 1,200 articles in leading medical journals. The concept of CVD risk factors has become an integral part of the modern medical curriculum and has led to the development of effective treatment and preventive strategies in clinical practice.  In addition to research studies focused on risk factors, subclinical CVD and clinically apparent CVD, Framingham investigators have also collaborated with leading researchers from around the country and throughout the world on projects involving some of the major chronic illnesses in men and women, including dementia, osteoporosis and arthritis, nutritional deficiencies, eye diseases, hearing disorders, and chronic obstructive lung diseases.  **Genetic Research in the Framingham Heart Study.** While pursuing the Study's established research goals, the NHLBI and the Framingham investigators has expanded its research mission into the study of genetic factors underlying CVD and other disorders. Over the past two decades, DNA has been collected from blood samples and from immortalized cell lines obtained from Original Cohort participants, members of the Offspring Cohort and the Third Generation Cohort. Several large-scale genotyping projects have been conducted in the past decade. Genome-wide linkage analysis has been conducted using genotypes of approximately 400 microsatellite markers that have been completed in over 9,300 subjects in all three generations. Analyses using microsatellite markers completed in the original cohort and offspring cohorts have resulted in over 100 publications, including many publications from the Genetics Analysis Workshop 13. Several other recent collaborative projects have completed thousands of SNP genotypes for candidate gene regions in subsets of FHS subjects with available DNA. These projects include the Cardiogenomics Program of the NHLBI's Programs for Genomics Applications, the genotyping of ~3000 SNPs in inflammation genes, and the completion of a genome-wide scan of 100,000 SNPs using the Affymetrix 100K Genechip.  **Framingham Cohort Phenotype Data.** The phenotype database contains a vast array of phenotype information available in all three generations. These will include the quantitative measures of the major risk factors such as systolic blood pressure, total and HDL cholesterol, fasting glucose, and cigarette use, as well as anthropomorphic measures such as body mass index, biomarkers such as fibrinogen and CRP, and electrocardiography measures such as the QT interval. Many of these measures have been collected repeatedly in the original and offspring cohorts. Also included in the SHARe database will be an array of recently collected biomarkers, subclinical disease imaging measures, clinical CVD outcomes as well as an array of ancillary studies.

phs000171.v1.p1::: A Case-Controlled Study for Genotype-Phenotype Associations in Multiple Sclerosis (MS):::Study Description   This is a multi-centre, case-controlled study to develop a dataset containing 1000 MS cases and 1000 matched controls and to associate DNA sequence (allelic) variations with MS phenotypes.  Study subjects were enrolled through a prospective effort initiated in 2003. Three MS clinical centres were involved in subject recruitment and biological specimen collection using identical inclusion/exclusion criteria, two in Europe (Vrije Universiteit Medical Center, Amsterdam; and University Hospital Basel) and one in the US (University of California San Francisco). This study recruited subjects of northern-European ancestry with a diagnosis of MS ([McDonald et al., 2001][1]), with dissemination in time and space. Patients with Clinically Isolated Syndromes (CIS) were also included if they fulfilled 3 of the 4 Barkhof criteria for dissemination in space as per application of the McDonald criteria ([McDonald et al., 2001][1]). While recruitment predominantly included subjects with a relapsing onset of MS, individuals with all clinical subtypes of the disease participated, including clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS), and progressive relapsing MS (PRMS).  The control group consisted of unrelated individuals, primarily spouses/partners, friends, and other volunteers. Control subjects were of northern-European ancestry and matched as a group, proportionally with cases according to age (5 years) and gender. A familial history or current diagnosis of MS as well as a relation to another case or control subject were considered exclusionary for this group.  Protocols were approved by the Committees on Human Research at all Institutions and informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to participation in the study.  **Primary Study Objective:**  >To identify DNA sequence variations (genotype) and flanking sequences that are associated with clinical factors (phenotype) which differ between study subjects with and without MS.<p>  **Secondary Study Objectives:**    1. To develop a clinical dataset including quantitative measures of 1000 well-characterized cases with MS, and 1000 ethnically matched controls.    2. To identify other genotype-phenotype associations in MS study subjects such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of disease burden and/or severity.    3. To identify or confirm candidate surrogate markers of neurodegeneration using a variety of techniques including biochemical assays, blood transcriptome analysis, plasma proteomics and MRI*.  **_Genotyping_**  >Genotyping of the complete dataset was performed at the Illumina facilities using the Sentrix&#174; HumanHap550 BeadChip.<p>  _*MRI results are not available on dbGaP._    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1920  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11456302  :::Case-Control::: 1920:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000502.v1.p1::: Genome-Wide Analysis of Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma:::Study Description   Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma (SMZL) is a B-cell malignancy of unknown pathogenesis and thus orphan of targeted therapies. By integrating whole-exome sequencing and copy-number analysis of 8 paired tumor-normal DNAs from patients with SMZL, we show that the typical SMZL exome carries ~30 genetic alterations. Targeted resequencing of selected candidates in an extended panel of 40-117 samples revealed activating mutations of NOTCH2, a gene required for marginal-zone (MZ) development, as the most frequent and SMZL-specific lesion, accounting for approximately 20% of cases. Additional altered genes suggest that deregulation of signaling pathways normally involved in MZ development (NOTCH, NF-kappa B, and B-cell receptor) represents a critical event in SMZL pathogenesis. These findings have direct implications for the treatment of SMZL patients since drugs are available which can target NOTCH as well as other pathways deregulated in this disease.    * Study Weblink: [Institute for Cancer Genetics][1]    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 8  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://icg.cumc.columbia.edu/  :::Case-Control::: 8:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000205.v5.p2::: International Standards for Cytogenomic Arrays:::Study Description   The International Standards for Cytogenomic Arrays (ISCA) Consortium is a rapidly growing group of clinical cytogenetics and molecular genetics laboratories committed to improving quality of patient care related to clinical genetic testing using new molecular cytogenetic technologies including array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and quantitative SNP analysis by microarrays or bead chip technology. The ISCA Consortium is now working with the sequencing community to extend the goals of standardization, collaboration, and data sharing. To reflect this combined effort, we are becoming ICCG, or the International Collaboration for Clinical Genomics.  Efforts of the Consortium include:  **Clinical Utility:** The ISCA Consortium has made recommendations regarding the appropriate clinical indications for cytogenetic array testing (Miller et al. AJHG 2010, PMID: [20466091][1]). Currently, discussions are focused on pediatric applications for children with unexplained developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism and other developmental disabilities. A separate committee has been developed to address appropriate cancer genetic applications ([http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/ccmc/][2]).  **Evidence-based standards for cytogenomic array design:** The Consortium will develop recommendations for standards for the design, resolution and content of cytogenomic arrays using an evidence-based process and an international panel of experts in clinical genetics, clinical laboratory genetics (cytogenetics and molecular genetics), genomics and bioinformatics. This design is intended to be platform and vendor-neutral (common denominator is genome sequence coordinates), and is a dynamic process with input from the broader genetics community and evidence-based review by the expert panel (a Steering Committee with international representation).  **Public Database for clinical and research community:** It is essential that a publicly available database be created and maintained for cytogenetic array data generated in clinical testing laboratories. This will be integrated into the current dbGaP database at NCBI/NIH and released through dbVar, and curated by a committee of clinical genetics laboratory experts. The very high quality of copy number data (i.e., deletions and duplications) coming from clinical laboratories combined with expert curation will produce an invaluable resource to the clinical and research communities.  **Standards for interpretation of cytogenetic array results:** Using the ISCA Database, along with other genomic and genetics databases, the Consortium will develop recommendations for the interpretation and reporting of pathogenic vs. benign copy number changes as well as imbalances of uncertain clinical significance.  **Membership** in the ISCA Consortium is open to all individuals and laboratories involved in cytogenetic array testing who are committed to free data sharing and to participation in a process to develop evidence-based standards and guidelines to improve patient care.  **ISCA is available through dbVar:**  > <a href="http:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/studies/nstd37" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/studies/nstd37/  > <a href="http:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/studies/nstd45" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/studies/nstd45/  > <a href="http:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/studies/nstd75/" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/studies/nstd75/    * Study Weblink: [International Standards for Cytogenomic Arrays][3]    * Study Type: Clinical Genetic Testing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 22034  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20466091     [2]: http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/ccmc/     [3]: https://www.iscaconsortium.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=artic le&id=62&Itemid=61  :::Clinical Genetic Testing::: 22034:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000329.v1.p1::: Functional and Genetic Characterization of BCR-ABL1 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL):::Study Description   Many tumour types are composed of genetically diverse cells, however little is known of how diversity evolves or the impact diversity has on functional properties. Here, using xenografting and DNA copy number alteration (CNA) profiling of human BCR-ABL1 lymphoblastic leukaemia, we demonstrate that genetic diversity occurs in functionally defined leukaemia-initiating cells (L-ICs) and that many diagnostic patient samples contain multiple genetically distinct L-IC subclones. Reconstructing the subclonal genetic ancestry of several samples by CNA profiling demonstrated a branching multi-clonal evolution model of leukaemogenesis, rather than linear succession. For some patient samples, the predominant diagnostic clone repopulated xenografts, while in others it was outcompeted by minor subclones. Reconstitution with the predominant diagnosis clone was associated with more aggressive growth properties in xenografts, deletion of CDKN2A/B, and poor patient outcome. Our findings link clonal diversity with L-IC function and underscore the importance of developing therapies that eradicate all intratumoural subclones.    * Study Types: Case Set, Tumor, Xenograft    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access:  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set, Tumor, Xenograft:::0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Estimated availability to be determined  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   Primary de novo BCR-ABL1 positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases in adults with material available for xenografting into immunodeficient mice.  :::AFFY_6.0:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ][1]    * [ Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays ][2]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68054198[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68023041[uid]  :::Study History   SNP 6.0 profiling of DNA copy number alterations was performed on primary human tumors, and the same tumors xenografted into immunodeficient mice.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * John Dick, PhD.

phs000294.v1.p1::: STAMPEED: Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (MIGen):::Study Description   Myocardial infarction (MI) is a common complex disease and the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The genetic basis of this disease is largely unknown. It has been thought that early-onset MI events would have a substantially greater heritability, thus making DNA collections with younger individuals desirable. More recently, genome-wide association studies have become feasible through the development of whole genome arrays and a large catalogue of common variants reported in the International HapMap database. This study aims to use Affymetrix genotyping platform to do a whole genome scan in 3000 early-onset MI cases and 3000 matched controls from 6 study collection sites.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 6042  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 6042:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000167.v1.p1::: Molecular Genetics of Schizophrenia - nonGAIN Sample (MGS_nonGAIN):::Study Description   This study is part of the Molecular Genetics of Schizophrenia (MGS) genome wide association study (GWAS) of 3,972 cases (2,686 EA and 1,286 AA) and 3,629 controls (2,656 EA and 973 AA) (analyzed sample remaining after quality control exclusions), comprised of European ancestry (EA) and African American (AA) samples. We genotyped about half of the EA sample and almost all of the AA sample under the auspices of the Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN) with the Affymetrix 6.0 platform at the Broad Institute. The remainder of the included sample was also genotyped with the Affymetrix 6.0 platform at the Broad Institute, and we refer to this component as the nonGAIN sample. Cases met criteria for schizophrenia (SCZ) or schizoaffective disorder (SA) per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders version IV (DSM- IV) for all three collections (SGI, MGS1, and MGS2) comprising these cases. However, for the older SGI collection, codes for the secondary diagnoses refer to the older DSM-III-R version. Controls were screened briefly and excluded if they endorsed a history of these illnesses.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 3029  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 3029:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000089.v3.p2::: NINDS-Genome-Wide Genotyping in Parkinson&#39;s Disease: First Stage Analysis and Public Release of Data:::Study Description   Epidemiological studies have estimated a cumulative prevalence of PD of greater than 1 per thousand. When prevalence is limited to senior populations, this proportion increases nearly 10-fold. The estimated genetic risk ratio for PD is approximately 1.7 (70% increased risk for PD if a sibling has PD) for all ages, and increases over 7-fold for those under age 66 years. The role for genes contributing to the risk of PD is therefore significant.  This study utilized the well characterized [collection of North American Caucasians with Parkinson's disease][1], and [neurologically normal controls][2] from the sample population which are banked in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS Repository) collection for a first stage whole genome analysis. Genome-wide, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping of these publicly available samples was originally done in 267 Parkinson's disease patients and 270 controls, and this has been extended to include genome wide genotyping in 939 Parkinson's disease cases and 802 controls.  The NINDS repository was established in 10-2001 towards the goal of developing standardized, broadly useful diagnostic and other clinical data and a collection of DNA and cell line samples to further advances in gene discovery of neurological disorders. All samples, phenotypic, and genotypic data are available to the research community including to academics and industry scientists. In addition, well characterized neurologically normal control subjects are a part of the collection. This collection formed the basis of this first stage study by Fung et al., and the expanded study by Simon-Sanchez et al. The genotyping data was generated and provided by the laboratory of Dr. Andrew Singleton NIA, and Dr. John Hardy NIA (NIH Intramural, funding from NIA and NINDS).  **Important links to apply for individual-level data**    1.

EGAS00000000064::: The patterns and dynamics of genomic instability in metastatic pancreatic cancer:::Study Description       Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy with a five-year mortality of 97-98%, usually due to widespread metastatic disease. Previous studies indicate that this disease has a complex genomic landscape, with frequent copy number changes and point mutations, but genomic rearrangements have not been characterized in detail. Despite the clinical importance of metastasis, there remain fundamental questions about the clonal structures of metastatic tumours, including phylogenetic relationships among metastases, the scale of ongoing parallel evolution in metastatic and primary sites, and how the tumour disseminates. Here we harness advances in DNA sequencing to annotate genomic rearrangements in 13 patients with pancreatic cancer and explore clonal relationships among metastases. We find that pancreatic cancer acquires rearrangements indicative of telomere dysfunction and abnormal cell-cycle control, namely dysregulated G1-to-S-phase transition with intact G2-M checkpoint. These initiate amplification of cancer genes and occur predominantly in early cancer development rather than the later stages of the disease. Genomic instability frequently persists after cancer dissemination, resulting in ongoing, parallel and even convergent evolution among different metastases. We find evidence that there is genetic heterogeneity among metastasis-initiating cells, that seeding metastasis may require driver mutations beyond those required for primary tumours, and that phylogenetic trees across metastases show organ-specific branches. These data attest to the richness of genetic variation in cancer, brought about by the tandem forces of genomic instability and evolutionary selection.    * Study Weblink: [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000064][1]    * Study Type: Whole Genome Sequencing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access:  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000064  :::Whole Genome Sequencing:::0::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: 
phs000314.v1.p1::: Genetic Associations in Idiopathic Talipes Equinovarus (Clubfoot) - GAIT:::Study Description   Isolated clubfoot or idiopathic talipes equinovarus (ITEV) is one of the five most common birth defects, affecting approximately 4,000 newborns each year in the US. While the orthopedic care of these children has improved, long-term problems persist and the health care costs are significant. Studies suggest that clubfoot is a complex disorder with segregation analyses and family studies indicating that genetic factors play an important etiologic role in the development of clubfoot. Only one environmental factor, maternal smoking during pregnancy, has been implicated. We postulate that a small number of genes account for a substantial fraction of clubfoot and that these genes can be identified in a defined population. The challenge now is to identify the genetic loci and, later, the effect of environmental exposures. To accomplish this task, it is important to have a well-defined population and the methodology to detect linkage with and without association. Towards these goals, we have identified and characterized multiplex clubfoot families, including two large clubfoot families, a resource which is among the largest ITEV populations in existence. We will perform a high-density SNP genome scan (GWAS) on our clubfoot dataset to identify chromosomal regions that may harbor clubfoot genes with subsequent interrogation of these regions and candidate genes. We are in a position with our unique clubfoot population and with the methodology in place to undertake this study. The study phases are: 1) continued ascertainment of multiplex and simplex families and 2) GWAS and characterization of identified chromosomal regions and candidate genes. The results of this study will provide data essential to the identification of the gene(s) contributing to the clubfoot phenotype. Identification of high-risk genotypes can lead to the development of prevention programs in selected populations and may suggest gene-based prevention strategies.    * Study Weblink: [Clubfoot][1]    * Study Types: Multiplex Families, Parent-Offspring Trios    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1903  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://ped1.med.uth.tmc.edu/genetics/research/Index_CF.htm  :::Multiplex Families, Parent-Offspring Trios::: 1903:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000602.v1.p1::: Identification of Targetable FGFR Gene Fusions in Diverse Cancers:::Study Description   In this study, patients with advanced cancer across all histologies were enrolled in our IRB approved clinical sequencing program, called MI-ONCOSEQ, to go through an integrative sequencing which includes whole exome sequencing of the tumor and matched normal, and transcriptome sequencing. Four index cases were identified which harbor gene rearrangements of FGFR2 including two cholangiocarcinoma cases, a metastatic breast cancer case, and a metastatic prostate cancer case. After extending our assessment of FGFR rearrangements across multiple tumor cohorts, including TCGA, we identified FGFR gene fusions with intact kinase domains of FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3 in cholangiocarcinoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung squamous cell cancer, bladder cancer, thyroid cancer, oral cancer, glioblastoma, and head and neck squamous cell cancer. All FGFR fusion partners tested exhibit oligomerization capability, suggesting a shared mode of kinase activation. Overexpression of FGFR fusion proteins in vitro induced cell proliferation, and bladder cancer cell lines that harbors FGFR3 fusion proteins exhibited enhanced susceptibility to pharmacologic inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Due to the combinatorial possibilities of FGFR family fusion to a variety of oligomerization partners, clinical sequencing efforts which incorporate transcriptome analysis for gene fusions are poised to identify rare, targetable FGFR fusions across diverse cancer types.    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 7  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set::: 7:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000050.v1.p1::: Genotyping the 270 HapMap samples for GAIN by Perlegen:::Study Description       For the GAIN studies, Perlegen Sciences uses a high-density oligonucleotide array-based platform to analyze ~600,000 SNPs in large numbers of individuals. The SNP set was selected on the basis of linkage disequilibrium analysis of the HapMap data, and includes tag SNPs for all CEU bins. The arrays consist of DNA probes (short segments of DNA) that are synthesized in pre-determined positions on glass surfaces, and are designed to differentially hybridize to reference and alternate SNP alleles. Samples are prepared by amplifying regions containing SNPs across the whole genome, labeling the amplicons, and hybridizing them to the arrays. After hybridization, the arrays are washed, stained, and scanned, and the resulting fluorescence intensities are used to determine the genotype of each SNP.    * Study Weblink: [GAIN The Genetic Association Information Network][1]    * Study Type: Parent-Offspring Trios    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 0  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.fnih.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=338&Itemid=454  :::Parent-Offspring Trios::: 0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000518.v1.p1::: NHLBI GO-ESP Family Studies: Idiopathic Bronchiectasis of unknown etiology that is not related to cystic fibrosis or classic primary ciliary dyskinesia or immune deficiency or any other known causes:::Study Description   The NHLBI "Grand Opportunity" Exome Sequencing Project (GO-ESP), a signature project of the NHLBI Recovery Act investment, was designed to identify genetic variants in coding regions (exons) of the human genome (the "exome") that are associated with heart, lung and blood diseases. These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied. These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease, contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention and treatments to specific populations. This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects. GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers - BroadGO and SeattleGO.  The major goal of this project is to apply next generation resequencing technology to identify disease-causing variants that cause bronchiectasis of unknown etiology (e.g. non cystic fibrosis (CF), classic primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), immune deficiency, or any other known cause of bronchiectasis), i.e., "idiopathic bronchiectasis."  As part of our ongoing efforts to define the genetic cause of rare lung diseases, we have also studied families in whom diagnosis of PCD or other known etiologies could not be confirmed. We have systematically collected and stored the DNA and phenotypic data on each of the families in our cohort. The phenotypic data includes age, gender, ethnicity information, clinical data pertaining to the airways disease, including neonatal respiratory distress, otitis media, sinusitis and bronchiectasis, ciliary ultrastructure analysis, and microbial colonization (status of nontuberculosis mycobacterium). During the course of our study, we have acquired 98 unrelated patients in whom bronchiectasis seemed to be of unknown causes. We will be using 11 unrelated patients, 5 unrelated affected sib-pairs, and 3 affected sibs from a family from this cohort, based on 1) development of bronchiectasis in the absence of smoking, 2) a good family pedigree with available DNA, and 3) a family history of bronchiectasis and/or occurrence of airways disease in a sibling. Classic CF, PCD and immune deficiency were ruled out, based on the tests described above. Alpha-1 antiprotease deficiency work up was negative and none of the patients were tobacco users or smokers.    * Study Weblink: [NHLBI GO-ESP Project][1]    * Study Type: Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 24  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://esp.gs.washington.edu/drupal  :::Cohort::: 24:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Hence, by the elimination of non-genetic causes of bronchiectasis, the genetic causes have become more evident. The current estimated prevalence of bronchiectasis is 4.2 per 100,000 persons 18-34 years old and 272 per 100,000 persons 75 years or older. Approximately, 50% of patients have bronchiectasis due to cystic fibrosis (CF). From the remaining half, the etiology is still missing from 30-35% of the patients and it would be extremely important to define the gene(s) causing bronchiectasis in these patients.  The molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways for idiopathic bronchiectasis are not well defined, as it is a polygenic disorder with extensive locus heterogeneity. Due to an incomplete understanding of the genetic causes and locus heterogeneity, tracking down genetic variants in the candidate gene would be inadequate, labor-intensive and time-consuming; hence, it would be useful to simultaneously interrogate the human genome.  While studying the rare lung diseases, we have excluded the known causes of bronchiectasis, using specialized techniques in our patients and hence availability of well-characterized patient population presents a unique opportunity to define causative genes using exomic sequencing platform.  Exome resequencing of an affected individual with a family history of bronchiectasis of unknown etiology represents a cost-effective and robust strategy for the sensitive and specific identification of the pathogenic protein-coding or splice variants.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigators **      * Michael Knowles, MD.

phs000333.v1.p1::: Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes (FIND) Study:::Study Description   The Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes (FIND) is a multicenter study designed to identify genetic determinants of diabetic kidney disease. Study subjects were recruited from eleven centers and in many ethnic groups throughout the United States. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted with the Affymetrix 6.0 chip.  Subjects (index cases) with diabetes and kidney disease were initially recruited, and their parents and siblings were invited to participate. Genetic material from these participants was used to genotype markers throughout the genome.  For association-based testing, a case-control design was implemented with study subjects selected primarily from the index cases of the families. Unrelated controls were selected from families where a case was not already selected. Several study sites also contributed non-FIND subjects, both cases and controls (consent forms for the release of FIND and non-FIND subjects/samples are included in this dbGaP release).  Cases were selected if they met study criteria for diabetic nephropathy or met inclusion criteria based on elevated serum creatinine levels and abnormal urine protein excretion. Similarly, controls were long-term diabetics with otherwise normal kidney function. See inclusion/exclusion criteria section for a detailed description for the FIND study as a whole and this GWAS.  The goal of the FIND study is to identify genes that influence susceptibility to diabetic kidney disease, leading to a better understanding of how kidney disease develops. In the long run, this may lead to improved treatment and prevention of diabetic kidney disease.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 2622  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 2622:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000333  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   Cases for the GWAS were selected from FIND probands or siblings (see Knowler, et al., PMID: [15642484][1]). The remaining cases, both FIND and non-FIND, were eligible if they had diabetic nephropathy or met one or more of the following criteria:    1. Albumin-to-Creatinine ratio (ACR)  0.3    2. Protein-Creatinine ratio (PCR)  0.5    3. Glomerular Filtration Rate (MDRD formula)  60    4. Serum Creatinine  1.6 mg/dL for Males, or  1.4 mg/dL for Females  For the GWAS, the above criteria are considered to be the _strict_ case inclusion criteria. Additional subjects were included in the GWAS, if they were azotemic and had normal proteinuria, based upon the following _loose_ case criteria:    1. ACR  0.03    2. GFR  60    3. Serum Creatinine  1.6 mg/dL for Males, or  1.4 mg/dL for Females  Controls were selected from the remaining unrelated FIND family members, FIND controls, and contributed non-FIND subjects. All controls were long term (10 years) diabetics with healthy kidney function based on one or more of the following criteria:    1. ACR  0.03    2. PCR  0.05    3. GFR  60    4. Serum Creatinine  1.6 mg/dL for Males, or  1.4mg/dL for Females  Subjects meeting the above criteria are considered controls based on _strict_ control inclusion criteria. Several subjects were allowed inclusion in the GWAS even if one or more of the above values was out of range. If a subject met at least three of the above criteria (or at least one of the above criteria in certain instances), the investigators reviewed the subject for further inclusion in the GWAS. If, based upon a full record review, the investigators determined the subject eligible for inclusion, the subject was allowed inclusion based upon _loose_ criteria. Furthermore, all controls subjects, strict and loose, have had diabetes for at least 10 years.  DNA samples for eligible cases and controls were sent to Affymetrix for sample processing and genotype contrast QC. Bird seed call-rate QC was performed by TGEN. Genotypes with call rates below 95% were re-genotyped and removed from further analysis if problems persisted.  FIND statisticians then applied further QC measures which included sex verification, calculating the proportion of heterozygous genotypes, duplicate sample concordance, and pairwise identity-by-descent (IBD) estimation. Samples with minor errors are listed in the "FIND_QC_ActionsForResolution" files included with this dataset.

These advances have the potential to dramatically impact drug discovery and development by identifying genetic factors that contribute to variation in disease risk as well as drug pharmacokinetics, treatment efficacy, and adverse drug reactions. In spite of the technological advancements, successful application in biomedical research would be limited without access to suitable sample collections. To facilitate exploratory genetic research, we have assembled a DNA resource from a large number of subjects participating in multiple studies throughout the world. This resource was initially genotyped using the Affymetrix 500K SNP panel. This project includes nearly 6,000 subjects of African American, East Asian, South Asian, Mexican, and European origin.  POPRES version 3  The discovery and development of novel drugs is challenging and with high attrition rates. Selection of the right target and optimal indications for novel therapeutics represent key decision points in this process, and are often hampered by our limited understanding of the biology of the target in humans. Building a robust body of knowledge of variation within drug target genes has in several cases increased the probability of success for novel therapeutics. Our knowledge of variation within drug target genes and their influence on traits of medical interest is still very limited. In an effort to fill this gap, we resequenced the exons of 202 known or suspected drug target genes in over 16,000 well-phenotyped individuals. A total of 863,883 bases were targeted, including 351 kb of coding and 323 kb of untranslated exon regions. The sequenced subjects included 3,381 from two studies that were part of the Population Reference Sample (POPRES) project: CoLaus (N = 2,059) and LOLIPOP (N = 1,322).

phs000365.v1.p1::: Exome Sequencing for Diseases of the Immune System: X-linked Immunodeficiency with Magnesium Defect, EBV Infection, and Neoplasia (XMEN):::Study Description   The etiologies of primary immunodeficiencies often yield novel insights about the immune system. Although a genetic etiology has been suspected for patients with abnormally low CD4+ T cells in the absence of HIV infection or any known causes of lymphopenia, no genetic mutation has been described to date for any case of primary CD4 lymphopenia. In this study, we characterized a non- consanguineous family with two non-HIV infected boys exhibiting an inverted CD4 to CD8 T cell ratio and a history of recurrent chronic viral infections since birth. Consistent with a decreased thymic output of CD4+ T cells, the percentage of CD31+ cells in the CD4+ naive population of these patients was decreased. In addition, the activation of T cells was significantly impaired in the patient upon TCR stimulation. Given the mother's T cells show completely skewed X chromosome inactivation, we suspected that the nature of this disease is X-linked. We performed X-chromosome exon-capture targeted single-end Solexa sequencing on two brothers and the mother and found a 10 base pair deletion at an intron-exon junction of Magnesium Transporter 1 (MAGT1), a Mg2+ specific transporter. We confirmed that this deletion leads to altered splicing, frameshift, early termination of the mRNA, and deficient protein expression in the lymphocytes of the two patients. Moreover, knockdown of this transporter in T cells isolated from healthy donors can recapitulate the observed T cell activation defect while its ectopic expression in the patients' lymphocytes can restore T cell stimulation. Our discovery highlights the significance of this transporter to T cell function.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 3  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 3:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000206.v3.p2::: Whole Genome Scan for Pancreatic Cancer Risk in the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium and Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium (PanScan):::Study Description   Within the framework of the NCI-sponsored Cohort Consortium, investigators from 12 prospective epidemiologic cohorts formed the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium in 2006. This study, also known as "PanScan", is funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and involves conducting a genome-wide association study of common genetic variants to identify markers of susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. In 2007, the study expanded to include 8 case-controls studies. The study team includes scientists from the cohorts comprising the Consortium and NCI and from the PanC4 case-control studies.  The PanScan consortium has conducted two GWAS that have led to the discovery of four novel regions in the genome associated with risk for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The first two scans were conducted in 12 cohort studies and 8 case-control studies.  Initially, we genotyped 523,345 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 1,528 incident cases and 1,594 controls from nested case-control studies of 12 cohorts plus 368 cases and 345 controls from one hospital-based case-control study. Taqman replication of SNPs from the three most promising regions in the initial scan, as determined by rank p-values, was done in 2,457 cases and 2,654 controls from eight case-control studies that were part of the PanC4 consortium. A combined analysis identified an association between a locus on 9q34 and pancreatic cancer, the single nucleotide polymorphism rs505922 (P= 5.37 x 10-8; multiplicative per-allele odds ratio (OR) 1.20; 95% CI 1.12-1.28), which maps to the first intron of the ABO blood group gene whose protein determines an individual's blood group (Amundadottir et al, Nature Genetics 2009, PMID: [19648918][1]).  In PanScan 2, we conducted a combined analysis of 3,851 pancreatic cancer cases and 3,934 controls. These included 1896 cases and 1939 controls that were scanned in PanScan1 (above) and 1955 cases and 1995 controls that were newly scanned in PanScan2. The second GWAS did not include 502 cases and 659 controls that were part of the rapid replication. (Please see the attached table for the total number of subjects who were GWASed and included in PanScan1 and PanScan2). Three new regions were identified: chromosome 13q22.1 (rs9543325; P=3.27 x 10-11; per-allele odds ratio (OR) 1.26; 95% CI 1.18-1.35); chromosome 1q32.1 in the NR5A2 gene (rs3790844; P=2.45 x 10-10; per-allele OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.71-0.84); and chromosome 5p15.33 (rs401681 in the CLPTM1L and TERT region; P=3.66 x 10-7; per-allele OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.11-1.27). The first two regions have not been identified in GWAS of cancer to date but the last region has been reported to be associated with risk of other malignancies (Petersen et al, Nature Genetics 2010, PMID: [20101243][2]).    * Study Weblink: [Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium][3]    * Study Types: Cohort, Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 7747  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19648918     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20101243     [3]: http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/PanScan/  :::Cohort, Case-Control::: 7747:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000443.v1.p1::: Transcriptome sequencing across a prostate cancer cohort identifies PCAT-1, an unannotated lincRNA implicated in disease progression:::Study Description   Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are emerging as key molecules in human cancer, with the potential to serve as novel markers of disease and to reveal uncharacterized aspects of tumor biology. Here we discover 121 unannotated prostate cancer-associated ncRNA transcripts (PCATs) by _ab initio_ assembly of high-throughput sequencing of polyA+ RNA (RNA-Seq) from a cohort of 102 prostate tissues and cells lines. We characterized one ncRNA, PCAT-1, as a prostate-specific regulator of cell proliferation and show that it is a target of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). We further found that patterns of PCAT-1 and PRC2 expression stratified patient tissues into molecular subtypes distinguished by expression signatures of PCAT-1-repressed target genes. Taken together, our findings suggest that PCAT-1 is a transcriptional repressor implicated in a subset of prostate cancer patients. These findings establish the utility of RNA-Seq to identify disease-associated ncRNAs that may improve the stratification of cancer subtypes.    * Study Type: Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 72  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Cohort::: 72:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

The exome sequences of two siblings and two unrelated individuals were obtained by massively parallel DNA sequencing. The four individuals were affected with Miller syndrome (OMIM: [263750][1]).  Additionally, the whole-genome sequences of a family of four were obtained with the method of Complete Genomics Incorporated (CGI). The two offspring were both affected with Miller syndrome and is the same sibling pair mentioned previously from whom exome sequences were also obtained.    * Study Types: Exome Sequencing, Pedigree Whole Genome Sequencing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 6  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/263750  :::Exome Sequencing, Pedigree Whole Genome Sequencing::: 6:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

A hypothesis was made that this gene would be identifiable as a gene common to all four individuals with Miller syndrome, wherein each individual had at least two novel, protein-changing variants in the gene after filtering against public SNP databases and HapMap exomes.  For analysis of whole genome data, a hypothesis was made that this gene would be identifiable as a gene shared by two siblings in a family with Miller syndrome. The gene should be in an IBD block. The defect in the gene should be detrimental. The variation responsible for the defect should be exceptionally rare. The two affected offspring in this family also have primary ciliary dyskinesia. Candidate genes identified in this study, consistent with a rare recessive inheritance mode, and shared by the two offspring include DHODH, DNAH5, KIAA0556, and CES1. DHODH was subsequently confirmed in additional affected individuals as being primarily responsible for Miller syndrome (PMID: [19915526][1]). DNAH5 is responsible for primary ciliary dyskinesia (OMIM: [603335][2]). The roles, if any, of KIAA0556 and CES1 in modulating phenotypes in this pedigree are currently unknown.

phs000086.v2.p1::: Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Study (EDIC):::Study Description   The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT, 1982-93) and the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications follow-up study (EDIC, 1994-2016) have been ongoing for more than twenty years. After a mean follow-up of approximately 16 years, the DCCT-EDIC cohort of 1,441 Type 1 diabetics had remained remarkably complete with more than 90% of the original cohort being actively followed. Taken together, the DCCT clinical trial and subsequent EDIC longitudinal follow-up provide a uniquely rich source of information on the impact of intensive therapy on glycemia and the its long- term complications for persons with Type 1 diabetes.  The DCCT was a multicenter, randomized clinical trial (1, 2) designed to compare intensive with conventional diabetes therapy with regard to their effects on the development and progression of the early complications of Type 1 diabetes. The DCCT trial found that "intensive therapy effectively delays the onset and slows the progression of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy" in patients with Type 1 diabetes (1). The goal of the EDIC follow- up was to examine the longer term effects of the original DCCT interventions, especially as they apply to late-occurring complications, such as cardiovascular disease and more advanced stages of retinal and renal disease (3). The EDIC study has been remarkably fruitful in discovering the long term "imprinting" effects (metabolic memory) of the previous intensive therapy, and in delineating the interactions among risk factors with regard to microvascular complications (4-6). In addition, EDIC established, for the first time, the role of intensive therapy and chronic glycemia on atherosclerosis (7-9).  **Note:** This study description has been prepared using materials authored by the DCCT-EDIC Data Coordinating Center.

phs000495.v1.p1::: The Gene Partnership (TGP) - eMERGE Data:::Study Description   The Gene Partnership (TGP) is a prospective longitudinal registry at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) to study the genetic and environmental contributions to childhood health and disease, collect genetic information on a large number of children who have been phenotyped, and implement the Informed Cohort and the Informed Cohort Oversight Board (ICOB). The term "_The Gene Partnership_" reflects a partnership between researchers and participants. Children seen at BCH are offered enrollment, as are their parents and siblings. DNA is collected on all enrollees. BCH has a comprehensive EMR system, and virtually all inpatient and outpatient data are captured electronically. Clinical data in the BCH EMR is loaded in the i2b2 data warehouse which is available to investigators. Cases, phenotypes, and covariates are ascertained using the i2b2 database. Participants at BCH in TGP have consented to receive any research result and/or incidental finding that arises from studies using TGP that is approved by the Informed Cohort Oversight Board (ICOB) and is in accordance with the participants' preferences; results are returned through the Personally Controlled Health Record (PCHR).

phs000452.v1.p1::: Melanoma Genome Sequencing Project:::Study Description   Melanoma is the most prevalent cause of skin cancer morbidity and mortality. In order to characterize the full range of somatic mutations that may drive the growth of melanoma, we are sequencing tumor and normal DNA from a set of roughly 150 melanomas. For the majority of samples (approximately 90% of the cases) mutations in protein coding genes will be assessed in the exonic DNA of tumor-normal pairs using hybrid capture and paired-end DNA sequencing. Additionally, in a few DNA samples (approximately 10% of the cases) the entire genomes will be analyzed to assess the possible contribution of complex structural rearrangements contributing to oncogenesis. The sequencing data are supplemented by copy number profiling on the same tumors using high-density SNP arrays. Integration of these approaches will enable the unbiased and comprehensive characterization of both known and novel recurrent DNA alterations that arise in melanoma.    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 122  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set::: 122:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

DNA was assessed for high quality and integrity on Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays and by agarose gel electrophoresis. SNP comparison was used to confirm that a sequenced tumor-normal pair could be attributed to the same individual and that no significant contamination by foreign DNA was present. Gross copy number analysis based on the SNP array data confirmed aberrant copy number in the case of the melanoma samples and diploid, unremarkable copy number profiles in the case of the normal samples.  :::AFFY_6.0;HiSeq 2000;HiSeq 2000;HiSeq 2000:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Melanoma ][1]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68008545[uid]  ::: :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Levi Garraway, M.D. Ph.

phs000274.v1.p1::: Genome-Wide Association Study of Celiac Disease:::Study Description   Celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy, celiac sprue) is a common disease with significant morbidity and mortality. It is caused by sensitivity to the dietary protein gluten, resulting in a chronic enteropathy in the small intestine. Celiac disease is now recognized to be a common disease, with reports that the disease frequency is 1:133 in the United States, similar to European estimates. There is recent evidence to suggest that the incidence of the disease is rising. Occult disease is frequently present with minimal classic symptoms or signs. The ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic celiac disease is estimated to be 1:7. Some complications of celiac disease include lymphoma, osteoporosis, anemia, miscarriages, seizures, vitamin deficiencies, and co-occurrence of other autoimmune diseases. The only treatment is a gluten-free diet, so that recurrence of symptoms and complications may occur after minor dietary indiscretions. Identifying the underlying genetic causes of celiac disease may allow us to identify susceptible individuals, as well as advance new ways to prevent the disease and to treat it once it occurs.  Several genome-wide linkage studies and one genome-wide association study of celiac disease have been conducted. Other than the common locus at HLA, few putative celiac disease loci have been replicated between studies, suggesting that the disease is heterogeneous and complex. A portion of the genetic predisposition can be attributed to HLA, but the etiology is likely due to a number of rare, high penetrant genes (as would be identified in linkage analysis) and to more common, low penetrant genes (as would be identified in association studies).  The objective of this study is to identify new loci that increase risk to develop celiac disease. We will capitalize on existing North American resources, including three large collections of celiac cases and controls (Aim 1) and an independent set of celiac cases and their families (Aim 3). We propose a comprehensive multi-stage approach, with the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will conduct a genome-wide association (GWA) study of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs). The GWA will include1900 disease cases and 3400 matched controls, genotyped using the Illumina Human 610-quad chip. Statistical analyses will be performed to test for associations with celiac disease. In Aim 2, we will conduct a combined analysis of our GWA dataset from Aim 1 and a previous GWA dataset to identify additional low-penetrance loci. In Aim 3, we will attempt to replicate significant findings from the GWA study in two independent sample sets. At the conclusion of this study, we expect to have validated a number of SNPs and CNPs from regions in the genome that alter the risk of developing celiac disease. These SNPs may prove useful at both the clinical and research level. The data from the study will be shared with the scientific community.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 2300  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 2300:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

From studies of subsets of these families, we have reported the results of linkage analysis and candidate gene analysis, have developed a rapid, inexpensive PCR-based HLA-genotyping method, and have examined risk of celiac disease and issues of diagnoses in family members. As we and others were unable to identify high penetrant rare alleles through linkage analysis, we moved to association studies. For that study, a North American Consortium was formed to utilize previously collected cases and controls.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigators **      * Susan Neuhausen, PhD.

We performed a genome-wide association scan using 317,501 SNPs in 720 women of European ancestry with SLE and in 2,337 controls, and we genotyped consistently associated SNPs in two additional independent sample sets totaling 1,846 affected women and 1,825 controls. Aside from the expected strong association between SLE and the HLA region on chromosome 6p21 and the previously confirmed non-HLA locus IRF5 on chromosome 7q32, we found evidence of association with replication (1.1 x 10-7 < P(overall) < 1.6 x 10-23; odds ratio = 0.82-1.62) in four regions: 16p11.2 (ITGAM), 11p15.5 (KIAA1542), 3p14.3 (PXK) and 1q25.1 (rs10798269). We also found evidence for association (P < 1 x 10-5) at FCGR2A, PTPN22 and STAT4, regions previously associated with SLE and other autoimmune diseases, as well as at > or =9 other loci (P < 2 x 10-7).

Also, lupus is a female dominated disease, with over 90% of the cases affecting women. Therefore, there is strong support for the effort to include multiple minority populations in the subject groups.<p>  Since multiplex pedigrees are being enrolled, a wide range of subject ages will also be included in the study. Although SLE is rare among children, pediatric SLE patients will be included in the study with consent of their parents.

phs000417.v2.p1::: BrainCloud: Data from human postmortem brain procurement for the neuropathology section:::Study Description   This study explores the temporal dynamics and genetic control of transcription and DNA methylation in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in postmortem tissue. This study examines 269 subjects for gene expression (version 1) and 108 subjects for DNA methylation (version 2). The subjects are normal controls without neuropathological and neuropsychiatric diagnosis and range in age from fetal weeks 14-20 through old age (>80). We discover fast changes in gene expression occurring during early brain development. Later in life, the changes are considerably slower. Many genes reverse pattern of expression between fetal and early postnatal development. We identify thousands of strong associations of SNPs with gene expression. We examine DNA methylation in ~14,500 genes at ~27,000 CpG loci focused on 5' promoter regions. The fastest changes in DNA methylation also occur during the prenatal period, slow down markedly after birth and continue to slow further with aging. DNA methylation is strongly associated with genotypic variants and correlates with expression of a subset of genes. DNA for genotyping was obtained from the cerebella and applied to either Illumina 650K or 1 million BeadArrays - only genotypes common to both platforms are analyzed here.

phs000219.v1.p1::: Multi-Site Collaborative Study for Genotype-Phenotype Associations in Alzheimer&#39;s disease and Longitudinal follow-up of Genotype-Phenotype Associations in Alzheimer&#39;s disease and Neuroimaging component of Genotype-Phenotype Associations in Alzheimer&#39;s disease:::Study Description   GenADA is a multi-site collaborative study, involving GlaxoSmithKline Inc and nine medical centres in Canada, to develop a dataset containing 1000 Alzheimer's disease patients and 1000 ethnically-matched controls in order to associate DNA sequence (allelic) variations in candidate genes with Alzheimer's disease phenotypes. The study consists of both retrospective and prospective components, that is, patients with an existing diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease as well as newly diagnosed patients were enrolled in the study. Thus, clinical data was retrospectively or prospectively obtained on Day 1 of entry into GenADA. Where possible, biological relatives with Alzheimer's (up to third degree relationship such as cousins) and unaffected siblings of AD cases were also recruited. Note that recruitment numbers for biological relatives were lower than expected and genotypic data has not been submitted to dbGap for these subjects.  The purpose of this study is:  > <ul> <li>To identify DNA sequence variations (genotype) in candidate genes that are associated with the clinical symptoms and behavioural features of Alzheimer&#39;s disease (phenotype), which differ between study participants with and without the disease.<li>  * To identify other genotype-phenotype associations in cognitively impaired study participants such as age of onset, family history, rate of cognitive decline, patterns of behavioural/psychiatric non-cognitive symptoms factors, response to treatment co-morbid conditions, and risks/exposure.  The final subject recruitment for this study included 875 Alzheimer's disease patients, 850 ethnically-matched controls, and 37 family members.  GenADA LONG is a longitudinal assessment to the original GenADA study. Eligible subjects were recruited from five of the nine memory clinics that participated in the GenADA study. Mild to moderate AD participants, a matched subset of controls, and biological related siblings (both affected and unaffected) or other blood relatives affected with AD, were initially examined a minimum of 12 months from recruitment into the original GenADA study, then at two further intervals of 12 and 18 months after time of entry into GenADA LONG. This enables an evaluation of the disease progression in AD patients and a determination of whether controls show evidence of cognitive decline. The overall goal of this extension study is to identify genetic differences and environmental influences that modulate the age of onset of the disease, the course of the disease, and/or biomarkers for neurodegenerative processes.  Three of the five memory clinics that participated in the GenADA LONG study recruited eligible patients into GenADA Imaging.  A concurrent neuroimaging sub-study was conducted at three of the five memory clinics participating in GenADA LONG. Eligible AD cases with mild to moderate AD, who were recruited into the original GenADA study and participated in the GenADA LONG extension study, were enrolled. Additionally, controls that showed signs of cognitive decline, as part of the assessment in GenADA LONG, were imaged at baseline, 12 and 18 month scanning intervals. The objective of this study is to find genes that: affect changes in AD brain volume measure by magnetic resonance in order to investigate how well change in brain volume predicts other key clinical measures in AD, such as neurodegenerative scales; that correlate changes in brain volume for other genotype-phenotype associations in cognitively impaired study participants; and that correlate with other clinically applicable magnetic resonance measures of pathology that can be conducted at the same time as structural volume measures, and are complementary to the volume measures.  The ultimate aim of this research is to obtain a better understanding and definition of Alzheimer's Disease in order to develop new improved medicines.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1718  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 1718:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000310.v1.p1::: Discovery of Non-ETS Gene Fusions in Human Prostate Cancer using Next Generation RNA Sequencing:::Study Description   ** Important Links and Information **    * [Instructions][1] to request Authorized Access    * [Data Use Certification Agreement][2]    * [Apply for Authorized Access ][3]  Half of prostate cancers harbor gene fusions between _TMPRSS2_ and members of the _ETS_ transcription factor family. To date little is known about the presence of non-ETS fusion events in prostate cancer. We employed next- generation transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) in order to explore the whole transcriptome of 25 human prostate cancer samples for the presence of chimeric fusion transcripts. We generated more than 1 billion sequence reads and used a novel computational approach (FusionSeq) in order to identify novel gene fusion candidates with high confidence. In total, we discovered and characterized seven new cancer-specific gene fusions, two involving the ETS genes _ETV1_ and _ERG_, and five involving non-ETS genes such as _CDKN1A_ (p21), _CD9_ and _IKBKB_ (IKK-beta), genes known to exhibit key biological roles in cellular homeostasis or assumed to be critical in tumorigenesis of other tumor entities, as well as the oncogene PIGU and the tumor suppressor gene _RSRC2_. The novel gene fusions are found to be of low frequency but interestingly, the non-ETS fusions were all present in prostate cancer harboring the _TMPRSS2-ERG_ gene fusion. Future work will focus on determining if the ETS rearrangements in prostate cancer are associated or directly predispose to a rearrangement prone phenotype.    * Study Type: Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 28  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=NHGRI_DAC_Supplemental_Instruction.pdf     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000310.v1.p1     [3]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login  :::Cohort::: 28:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000139.v1.p1::: International Multiple Sclerosis Genomics Consortium (IMSGC) Genome Wide Association Study of Multiple Sclerosis:::Study Description   The goal of this study is to perform a comprehensive allelic and genotypic association analysis of the entire human genome in multiple sclerosis. The recent definitive linkage genome screen demonstrated that there is no other MS risk gene with an effect size anywhere near that of the MHC. However, linkage analysis is significantly hampered by reduced power in the face of heterogeneity and requires multiplex families, which also hampers acquiring an appropriate sample size. In contrast, genotyping 500K SNPs allows us to survey a significant amount of the genome (we estimate >70%) directly for allelic or genotypic association. This uses the improved power of association analysis and can also take advantage of the linkage disequilibrium relationships among SNPs to further increase power (e.g. haplotype analysis). Quality control and data analysis are significant challenges. We will initially perform substantial QC checks and analyze the data using both TDT and AFBAC approaches. Multigenic interactions will also be tested using MDR.    * Study Weblink: [International Multiple Sclerosis Consortium][1]    * Study Type: Parent-Offspring Trios    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 3002  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.imsgc.org/  :::Parent-Offspring Trios::: 3002:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000139  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   An MS specialist confirmed an MS diagnosis for collection site participants in this study. The diagnosis of MS was made according to the McDonald criteria after review of all available clinical data. Complete clinical data was available for over 95.0% of patients. Disease course was recorded for patients at entry to study as either relapsing-remitting (RR), secondary progressive (SP), primary progressive (PP), or relapsing-progressive (PR) 4. Disability was also assessed at entry with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 5. SPMS was characterized by six months of worsening neurological disability not explained by relapse and measured as a deterioration of either: i) one or more points on the EDSS in patients with an EDSS less than 6, or ii) a one-half point or more for those with an EDSS > 6. PPMS was characterized both by 1) progressive clinical worsening for more than 12 months from symptom onset without any relapses, and 2) abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as defined by the presence of two or more oligoclonal bands or elevated IgG index in the CSF. If acute relapses were superimposed on this steadily progressive course, patients were considered to have PRMS. CIS was characterized as the first, well-defined neurological event lasting more than 48 hours, and which involved the optic nerve, spinal cord, brainstem, or cerebellum. In patients presenting with a CIS, the presence of two or more hyper-intense lesions on a T2-weighted MRI sequence was also required for enrollment into the study. A small number of subjects with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) were included among the US samples used for this study. For the purpose of the analysis, they were treated as cases of "relapsing-remitting" cases of MS since they represent one tail of the distribution of the demyelinating disease spectrum and a majority of them will go on to have a second attack or show evidence of disease progression.  :::Mapping250K_Nsp;Mapping250K_Sty:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Multiple Sclerosis ][1]    * [ Multiple Sclerosis, Chronic Progressive ][2]    * [ Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting ][3]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68009103[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68020528[uid]     [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68020529[uid]  ::: :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigators **      * Alastair Compston, F.Med.Sci, PhD.

With the exception of HLA-B51, which explains less than 20% of the genetic risk, the identities of alleles that are responsible for the complex inheritance of this disease have remained unclear.<p>  **Aim**  >To identify genes that contribute to BD susceptibility.<p>  **Methods**  >A genome-wide association study was undertaken with 311,459 informative and high quality SNPs in a collection of 1215 BD patients and 1278 healthy controls from Turkey using a beadchip microarray assay (Infinium SNP genotype assay, Illumina). HLA-B types were determined with a reverse sequence-specific oligonucleotide method (One Lambda). Regions with evidence for association were fine-mapped using Sequenom iPLEX gold assays. Disease-associated SNPs were genotyped in additional ethnically matched casecontrol collections from diverse genetic backgrounds, including a total of 2430 cases and 2660 controls, using TaqMan SNP genotype assays. Association data were combined in a meta-analysis of all the collections.  **Results**  >We confirmed the known association with HLA-B51 and found evidence for a second, independent susceptibility locus in the Class I region of the MHC. In addition, we identified one SNP with genome-wide evidence for disease association (P &lt; 5.0 x 10<sup>-8<sup>) within the gene encoding the immunoregulatory cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL10). A meta-analysis of the data from all the collections established associations with the IL10 variant (rs1518111, P = 3.54 x 10-18, odds ratio 1.45 with 95% confidence interval 1.34 to 1.58) and with a variant located between the interleukin-23 receptor (IL23R) and interleukin 12 receptor 2 (IL12RB2) genes (rs924080, P = 6.69 x 10-9, odds ratio 1.28 with 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 1.39). The disease- associated IL10 variant was associated with diminished mRNA expression and low protein production by cells obtained from healthy blood donors.  **Conclusions**  >These data suggest that genetically encoded low production of IL-10 increases risk of BD and suggest novel interventional targets in the IL-10 and IL-23 pathways.<p>  Note: The submitted data are the genotypes of the 311,459 SNPs in 1215 cases and 1278 controls.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 2493  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 2493:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000549.v1.p1::: Clonal Evolution of Pre-Leukemic Hematopoietic Stem Cells Precedes Human Acute Myeloid Leukemia:::Study Description   Acute myeloid leukemia is an aggressive clonal malignancy of the bone marrow that is the direct result of sequential acquisition of mutations in a single lineage of cells. In this study, we investigate a model in which this mutational acquisition occurs serially in long-lived self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells eventually resulting in frank acute myeloid leukemia. Coding mutations in multiple AML patients were identified using exome sequencing followed by sanger sequencing validation. The level of these mutations was then assessed in residual hematopoietic stem cells from each patient using targeted deep sequencing. These population-level estimates of mutant allele burden were then validated in single cell assays targeted to the identified mutations. This allowed for determination of the order of acquisition of the mutations that preceded the development of the leukemia. The results of this study identify pre-leukemic hematopoietic stem cell clones that could contribute to patient relapse and outcome.    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 6  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set::: 6:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000582.v1.p1::: NHLBI GO-ESP: Family Studies (Familial Interstitial Pneumonia):::Study Description   The NHLBI "Grand Opportunity" Exome Sequencing Project (GO-ESP), a signature project of the NHLBI Recovery Act investment, was designed to identify genetic variants in coding regions (exons) of the human genome (the "exome") that are associated with heart, lung and blood diseases. These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied. These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease, contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention and treatments to specific populations. This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects. GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers - BroadGO and SeattleGO.  The Familial Interstitial Pneumonia (FIP) project seeks to identify genetic variants in coding regions of the human genome that are linked to FIP by examining the coding regions among relatives with FIP. These data will be used in conjunction with our other genetic studies to help us better understand how and why some individuals develop pulmonary fibrosis.    * Study Weblink: [NHLBI Grand Opportunity Exome Sequencing Project (ESP)][1]    * Study Type: Family    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 12  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://esp.gs.washington.edu/drupal/  :::Family::: 12:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000582  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   Inclusion: Familial Interstitial Pneumonia (FIP) families qualify for this study after the evaluation described below identifies the presence of two or more cases of definite or probable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) in individuals genetically related within three degrees. In at least one of these cases, the IIP diagnosis must be definite/probable idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis/usual interstitial pneumonia (IPF/UIP); requiring one case of IPF/UIP anchors the FIP families with the most common and severe form of IIP and creates consistency between the families.  Exclusion: Because this is a study of genetic etiological factors in pulmonary fibrosis, we exclude subjects with: 1) medical conditions associated with the development of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including collagen vascular diseases; 2) clinically significant medication, drug, occupational, environmental, or avocational exposures known to be associated with the development of ILD; 3) known genetic diseases associated with ILD, such as Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, Neimann-Pick disease, Gaucher's disease, and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia; and 4) cases of pulmonary fibrosis occurring in those less than 20 years of age. Although early onset cases are often considered to be valuable in genetic studies, it is very likely that cases of ILD occurring before age 20 do not represent pulmonary fibrosis and are likely to be etiologically different than cases of ILD in adults.  :::HiSeq 2000:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ][1]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68054990[uid]  :::Study History   We have been conducting a linkage study in Familial Interstitial Pneumonia (FIP) for over a decade.

phs000101.v3.p1::: NIH Genome-Wide Association Studies of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis:::Study Description   The cause of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is unknown. To identify the genetic factors underlying this fatal neurodegenerative disease, we performed a series of genome-wide association studies of ALS. These studies are divided into three distinct stages, each associated with a separate data release. A description of each stage is provided below.  In the first stage, we genotyped 555,352 SNPs in 276 US cases diagnosed with ALS and 271 US controls. These samples were obtained from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) DNA Repository at Coriell. The 276 US cases were genotyped on Illumina HumanHap550v1.1 SNP arrays, whereas the 271 US controls were genotyped on both Illumina HumanHap250Sv1.0 and Illumina HumanHap300v1.1 SNP arrays. The genotype data was released in June 2008 under the accession number [phs000101.v1.p1][1] and was associated with the following publication: Schymick JC et al. (2007) [Genome-wide genotyping in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and neurologically normal controls: first stage analysis and public release of data][2]. _Lancet Neurology_ 6:322-8.  In the second stage, we extended our genotyping to a larger cohort to identify risk factors with lower effect size. This portion of the project used a two- step approach: in step A, 545,066 SNPs were genotyped in 553 individuals with ALS and 2,338 controls. Of note, this cohort included data from the 276 US cases and 271 US controls that had been previously released in the first stage, [phs000101.v1.p1][1]. The additional 277 ALS cases that were newly genotyped in this stage were collected in a population-based manner from the North of Italy and were genotyped on Illumina HumanHap550v1.1 SNP arrays. In step B, we brought forward the 7,600 most associated SNPs from step A, and genotyped them in an additional cohort consisting of 2,160 cases and 3,008 controls using an Illumina iSelect custom designed SNP array. The new data generated from this study was released in May 2010 ([phs000101.v2.p1][3]) and consisted of 1,456 case samples and 773 control samples for which participants provided consent to make their data publicly available. We do not have permission to publicly release the genotype data from the rest of the samples. This data release was associated with the following publication: Chio A et al. (2009) [A two-stage genome wide association study of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis][4]. _Human Molecular Genetics_ 18:1524-32.  In the third stage, we genotyped 601,273 SNPs in an additional set of 236 Italian ALS cases. Together with the 264 Italian samples genotyped as part of stage 2, this brought the total number of samples that were whole genome genotyped samples to 504. These additional 236 patients had been collected in a population-based manner from the Piedmonte region in the North of Italy, and were genotyped using Illumina Human610Quad.v1 SNP arrays. The rational for this stage of the study arose from a _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)_ publication by Landers et al. 2009, hypothesizing that genetic variation on chromosome 1q24 in the vicinity of the KIFAP3 gene was associated with a significant improvement in survival of ALS patients. Our data failed to replicate this finding suggesting that the original finding may have been a false positive finding. The data generated for the extra 236 Italian ALS cases used in this study was released in April 2011 ([phs000101.v3.p1][5]). This data release was associated with the following publication: Traynor BJ et al. (2010) [Kinesin-associated protein 3 (KIFAP3) has no effect on survival in a population-based cohort of ALS patients][6]. PNAS 107:12335-8. Of note, 95 of these 236 samples had also been genotyped on the Illumina iSelect custom designed SNP array used in the second stage of this study (see README.txt file available through dbGaP Authorized Access for list of the 95 samples).  This study utilized the [NINDS Repository Motor Neuron Disease/ALS Study][7], and [neurologically normal controls][8] from the sample population which are banked in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS Repository) collection.    * Study Weblinks: [NINDS Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis][9]; [NINDS Repository at Coriell Motor Neuron Diseases Resources][10]    * Study Types: Case-Control, Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 2914  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000101.v1.p1     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17362836     [3]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000101.v2.p1     [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19193627     [5]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000101.v3.p1     [6]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20566859     [7]: ./study.cgi?id=phs000006     [8]: ./study.cgi?id=phs000004     [9]: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/amyotrophiclateralsclerosis/amyotro phiclateralsclerosis.htm     [10]: http://ccr.coriell.org/Sections/Collections/NINDS/?SsId=10  :::Case-Control, Case Set::: 2914:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000525.v1.p1::: Expressed Pseudogenes in the Transcriptional Landscape of Human Cancers:::Study Description   In this study, we describe a systematic analysis of pseudogene 'transcription' from an RNA-Seq resource of 293 samples, from 13 cancer and normal tissue types. We observed a highly prevalent, genome-wide expression of pseudogenes that could be categorized as universally expressed or lineage- and/or cancer- specific. We also explored disease subtype specificity and functions of selected expressed pseudogenes. We provide evidence that transcribed pseudogenes are a significant contributor to the transcriptional landscape of cells and are positioned to play significant roles in cellular differentiation and cancer progression. Our work provides a transcriptome resource that enables high-throughput analyses of pseudogene expression.    * Study Type: Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 293  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Cohort::: 293:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000273.v1.p1::: High-Throughput LINE-1 Retrotransposon Discovery in Humans:::Study Description   The aim of this study is to discover LINE-1 (L1) insertion sites present in humans that are absent from the reference genome sequence. We use the distinguishing nucleotide characteristics of human-specific L1 elements to resequence the L1 3' flanking regions thus locating the L1 insertion sites whether or not they are present in the reference genome assembly. In doing so, we have uncovered a higher than expected number of non-reference L1 insertions, an average of 152 insertions per individual. In addition, we find that any two individuals differ at an average of 285 sites with respect to presence or absence of L1 insertions in those sites, and use this to estimate the rate of retrotransposition in humans at 1 event per 140 live births (95% c.i. 1/95 to 1/270). We show that individual 'L1 profiles' recapitulate genetic ancestry as expected, and find that dimorphic insertions are more frequent in introns relative to fixed insertions.    * Study Type: Marker Discovery    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 25  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Marker Discovery::: 25:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000130.v1.p1::: NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium Crohn&#39;s Disease Genome-Wide Association Study:::Study Description   This dataset contains data from a genome-wide association study performed with 968 Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) affected cases and 995 unrelated controls using the Illumina HumanHap300 Genotyping BeadChip. Cases were selected to have Crohn's disease with ileal involvement, and controls were matched to cases based on sex and year of birth. Subjects were drawn from two cohorts: (1) persons with non-Jewish, European ancestry (561 cases and 563 controls), and (2) persons with Jewish ancestry (407 cases and 432 controls). Genotyping was performed at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research.  Seven-hundred fifty-four of the samples (468 cases and 286 controls) were taken from the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium cell line repository. These samples are identified in the IBD_Sample file. The subject IDs for these individuals may be used to request corresponding samples for follow-up research through the repository. In addition, complete phenotype data for these individuals are available, together with the Consortium's phenotyping manual and the forms used to collect the data. The remaining 1,209 samples were obtained from pre-existing collections ascertained through Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Johns Hopkins University, University of Chicago, University of Montreal, University of Pittsburgh, University of Toronto, and the New York Health project (controls only). For these samples, only sex, cohort (Jewish vs. non-Jewish), and age at diagnosis (cases only) are available.  Two-hundred three individuals from among the pre-existing samples did not provide consent to release their genotype data (designated as consent group 2 in the file IBD_Subject). Thus, individual genotype data are only provided for 1,760 samples. To compensate for this, we have provided summary results for each SNP. These are based on a stratified analysis testing case/control association. Fifty-one samples had a call rate less than 93% and were therefore excluded from this analysis, leaving an overall sample size of 1,963 - 51 = 1,912.  X Chromosome Heterozygosity  > Nine samples have X chromosome heterozygosity that is neither consistent nor inconsistent with their phenotypic sex. One of these samples was found to have Turner Syndrome. The remaining 8 samples have heterozygosity ranging from 35-76%. <p>    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1963  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 1963:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000130  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   Cases were selected to have Crohn's disease with ileal involvement. After genotyping was completed and updated phenotype information was obtained, two (non-repository) cases were identified as having Indeterminate Colitis instead of Crohn's disease, and one Crohn's case was found not to have ileal involvement (these three samples are nonetheless included in the dataset).  Diagnosis of IBD required (i) one or more of the following symptoms: diarrhea, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, fever or complicated perianal disease; (ii) occurrence of symptoms on two or more occasions separated by at least 8 weeks or ongoing symptoms of at least 6 weeks duration and (iii) objective evidence of inflammation from radiologic, endoscopic and histologic evaluation. Ileal Crohn's disease involvement was defined as mucosal ulceration, cobblestoning, stricturing or bowel wall thickening from endoscopy reports, barium X-rays, operative reports and/or pathology resection specimen reports. Individuals with either 'ileal only' or 'ileocolonic' were included.  Within each of the non-Jewish and Jewish cohorts, controls were matched to cases based on sex and year of birth. In addition, controls were required to meet the following inclusion criteria: (1) no history of IBD among 1st and 2nd degree relatives, (2) never been diagnosed with IBD, and (3) never experienced chronic diarrhea, unexplained rectal bleeding, or unexplained weight loss.  :::HumanHap300v1.1:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Crohn Disease ][1]    * [ Colitis, Ulcerative ][2]    * [ Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ][3]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68003424[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68003093[uid]     [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68015212[uid]  :::Study History     1.

phs000297.v1.p1::: eMERGE Network Study of the Genetic Determinants of Resistant Hypertension:::Study Description   ** Important Links and Information **    * [Instructions][1] to request Authorized Access    * [Data Use Certification Agreement][2]    * [Apply for Authorized Access ][3]    * [Acknowledgement Statements][4]  The **_e_**lectronic **_M_**edical **_R_**ecords and **_Ge_**nomics (eMERGE) Network is a consortium of five participating sites (Group Health Seattle, Marshfield Clinic, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern University, and Vanderbilt University) funded by the NHGRI to investigate the use of electronic medical record systems for genomic research. The goal of eMERGE is to conduct genome- wide association studies in approximately 19,000 individuals using EMR-derived phenotypes and DNA from linked Biorepositories.  Using electronic phenotyping methods, the consortium used DNA samples from all participating sites to explore the genetic determinants of resistant hypertension. Treatment resistant hypertension is a common health problem in the clinical setting. A basic definition of resistant hypertension included subjects with uncontrolled blood pressure despite use of three antihypertensive medications or subjects requiring four or more medications to maintain control. Other conditions, such as secondary causes of hypertension, were exclusions.  Site and participants include:  **Vanderbilt University**: BioVU, Vanderbilt's DNA databank, is an enabling resource for exploration of the relationships among genetic variation, disease susceptibility, and variable drug responses, and represents a key first step in moving the emerging sciences of genomics and pharmacogenomics from research tools to clinical practice. BioVU acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care. The biobank is linked to de-identified clinical data extracted from Vanderbilt's EMR, which forms the basis for phenotype definitions used in genotype-phenotype correlations.  **Marshfield Clinic**: The Marshfield Clinic Personalized Medicine Research Project is a population-based biobank in central Wisconsin with more than 20,000 adult subjects who provided written, informed consent to access their medical records and provided a blood sample from which DNA was extracted and plasma and serum stored. In addition to an average of 30 years of medical history data, a questionnaire about environmental exposures, including a detailed food frequency questionnaire, is available to facilitate gene/environment studies.  **Northwestern University**: The NUgene Project is a repository with longitudinal medical information from participating patients at affiliated hospitals and outpatient clinics from the Northwestern University Medical Center. Participants' DNA samples are coupled with data from a self-reported questionnaire and continuously updated data from our Electronic Medical Record (EMR) representing actual clinical care events. Northwestern has a state-of- the art, comprehensive inpatient and outpatient EMR system of over 2 million patients. NUgene has broad access to participant data for all outpatient visits as well as inpatient data via a consolidated data warehouse. NUgene participants consent to distribution and use of their coded DNA samples and data for a broad range of genetic research by third-party investigators.  **Group Health(GH)/University of Washington (UW)**: Aging and Dementia eMERGE study biorepository leverages rich population-based longitudinal data from both electronic medical records and in-depth research data to explore genome wide associations. Participants include Seattle-area members of GH (a large integrated health care system in Washington State) consented and enrolled in 1) the UW Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry (ADPR) and 2) the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study. The ADPR (PI: Eric B. Larson; NIH/NIA U01 AG 006781) is a population-based registry of incident dementia cases designed to identify all new Alzheimer's Disease cases within GH from 1987 to 1996. Medical history, physical, laboratory testing, and neuropsychological testing were performed on all consenting potential cases for determination of dementia status by a consensus conference. The study base of the ADPR population was stable with an attrition rate of less than 1%/year. The ACT study (PI: Eric B. Larson; NIH/NIA U01 AG 006781) is an ongoing community-based cohort study of aging and dementia. The original cohort of 2,581 randomly selected dementia- free members age 65 and older was enrolled in 1994-1996 and expanded by 811 in 2000-2002. Continuous enrollment to maintain a cohort of 2,000 dementia free persons began in 2005. Participants receive biennial assessment including cognitive status determination. The ACT sub-sample is stable; for the original cohort, median enrollment in GH was 19 years prior to joining the ACT study, and 85% of the cohort has  10 years of GH enrollment. DNA for the ADPR participants were obtained through a companion study, Genetic Differences in Cases and Controls (PI: Walter Kukull; NIH/NIA R01 AG007584). DNA obtained through both studies were extracted from blood using Gentra Systems Puregene methods. DNA concentration is determined by UV optical density. All samples are checked for quality by 260/280 ratio. For long-term storage, samples are aliquoted and stored at -70C.  **Mayo Clinic**: The Mayo biobank is a disease-specific biobank for vascular diseases including peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD patients were identified from individuals referred to the non-invasive vascular laboratory for lower extremity arterial evaluation. Since 1997, laboratory findings have been recorded into an electronic database employing an in-house software package for data archiving and retrieval; this data becomes part of the Mayo EMR. Patients referred to the center with suspected PAD undergo a comprehensive non-invasive evaluation including the ankle-brachial index (ABI) - the ratio of blood pressure measured in the upper arms divided by blood pressure measured at the ankles. Controls subjects are identified from patients referred to the Cardiovascular Health Clinic for stress ECG. The prevalence of PAD in patients with normal exercise capacity who do not have inducible ischemia on the stress ECG, was <1%. Data regarding risk factors for atherosclerosis such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and smoking are ascertained from the EMR.    * Study Weblink: [The eMERGE Network][5]    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 5281  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=NHGRI_DAC_Supplemental_Instruction.pdf     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000297.v1.p1     [3]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [4]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=eMERGE_Acknowledgement.pdf     [5]: https://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/victr/dcc/projects/acc/index.php/Main_Page  :::Case-Control::: 5281:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were a primary care patient of a Geisinger Clinic physician and were scheduled for a non-emergent clinic visit. All participants provided written informed consent and HIPAA authorization. Consenting patient agreed to provide blood samples for broad biomedical research use, and permission to access data in their Geisinger electronic medical record for research. The enrollment rate was 90% of patients approached. The demographics of the cohort approximate those of the Geisinger Clinic outpatient population. Research blood samples were collected during an outpatient clinical phlebotomy encounter. Research blood samples are coded and stored in a central biorepository. Samples are linkable to clinical data in a de-identified manner for research via an IRB-approved data broker process. For genomic analysis, DNA is extracted from EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood. For the initial eMERGE Geisinger eGenomic Medicine (GeM) genotyping project, a subset of 1,232 unique samples were genotyped using Illumina HumanOmniExpress-12 v1.0 arrays, and used as population controls for other Geisinger Clinic case cohorts, including abdominal aortic aneurysm and gastric bypass surgery cases. These samples were selected from a larger subset of approximately 6,000 MyCode DNA samples using a partial matching algorithm that included age, sex, and body mass index as variables.    * Study Weblink: [The eMERGE Network][4]    * Study Type: Control Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1231  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000381.v1.p1     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [3]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=eMERGE_Acknowledgement.pdf     [4]: https://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/victr/dcc/projects/acc/index.php/Main_Page  :::Control Set::: 1231:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000234.v1.p1::: Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies:::Study Description   ** Important Links and Information **    * [Instructions][1] to request Authorized Access    * [Data Use Certification Agreement][2]    * [Apply for Authorized Access ][3]    * [Acknowledgement Statements][4]  The "Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies" project is collaboration between Group Health Cooperative (GH), the University of Washington (UW), and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). It is one of 5 sites participating in The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) with additional funding from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS). The overall eMERGE project is designed to assess whether linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies and whether information can be pooled across sites. The primary phenotype in the Group Health/UW Aging and Dementia eMERGE study project is dementia.  Phenotyped participants originated from four population-based sources. Seattle-area members of GH (a large integrated health care system in Washington State) consented and enrolled in 1) the University of Washington Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry (ADPR) and 2) the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, 3) Marshfield Clinic Personalized Medicine Research Project (PMRP), a population-based DNA, plasma and serum biobank of 20,000 adults, 4) Vanderbilt's BioVU, a de-identified DNA biobank.  The ADPR (PI: Eric B. Larson; NIH/NIA U01 AG 006781) is a population-based registry of incident dementia cases designed to identify all new dementia cases within GH from 1987 to 1996. Potential dementia cases were identified through referrals from primary care physicians, mental health services, and neurologists, as well as review of CT scans, neurology, emergency room, geriatrician, and mental health clinic logs, and hospital discharge diagnoses. Medical history, physical, laboratory testing, and neuropsychological testing were performed on all consenting potential cases. These data were reviewed by a consensus conference including a neuropsychologist, study physicians, and an epidemiologist. After discussion of the case, dementia status is assigned using DSM-III-R criteria. Alzheimer's disease status was assigned using the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke- Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria. The study base of the ADPR population was stable with an attrition rate of less than 1%/year.  The ACT study (PI: Eric B. Larson; NIH/NIA U01 AG 006781) is an ongoing community-based cohort study designed to determine the incidence of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), other types of dementia, and cognitive impairment and to determine risk factors for these conditions. The original cohort of 2,581 was enrolled in 1994-1996. An expansion cohort of 811 was enrolled in 2000-2002. Continuous enrollment to keep 2,000 persons enrolled and at-risk for dementia outcomes was begun in 2005. To date the study has accrued more than 4,000 participants. Dementia-free participants are enrolled in this cohort and evaluated every two years by study personnel with many evaluations including an assessment of cognitive functioning using the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), which is an extended version of the Mini-Mental State Examination that has been widely used in epidemiological studies of the elderly. Persons with CASI scores lower than 86 or in whom interviewers suspect unusual cognitive decline are followed up with dementia diagnostic evaluations which include physical and neurological examinations and neuropsychological tests. Medical records are reviewed, and laboratory tests and neuroimaging are obtained if not available. The dementia diagnoses and dementia subtypes are determined during a consensus conference attended by the examining clinicians and other study physicians, a neuropsychologist, and research nurse. After discussion of the case, dementia status is assigned using DSM-IV criteria. Alzheimer's disease status was assigned using NINCDS- ADRDA criteria. Individuals diagnosed with dementia are seen again one year following diagnosis using the same procedures. Individuals not diagnosed with dementia are returned to the pool of at-risk individuals and are seen at their next routinely scheduled biennial visit. The ACT sub-sample is stable; for the original cohort, median enrollment in GH was 19 years prior to joining the ACT study, and 85% of the cohort has  10 years of GH enrollment.  DNA for the ADPR participants were obtained through a companion study, Genetic Differences in Cases and Controls (PI: Walter Kukull; NIH/NIA R01 AG007584). DNA obtained through both studies were extracted from blood using Gentra Systems Puregene methods. DNA concentration is determined by UV optical density. All samples are checked for quality by OD 260/280 ratio. For long- term storage, samples are aliquoted and stored at -70C.  The Marshfield study, Personalized Medicine Research Project (PMRP), a population-based DNA, plasma and serum biobank of 20,000 adults. PMRP was started in 2002 as a 3 Phase project. Completed in April 2004, the objectives of Phase I were to build and develop a large population-based biobank with DNA, plasma and serum samples to facilitate genomics research. Phase 1 was also to educate, inform and consult with the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area population and communities concerning potential studies, create the DNA foundation of the personalized medicine database and build the bioinformatics tools to store securely and analyze genotypic and phenotypic data. Phase I tasks included operation of the ethics and security advisory board, scientific advisory board and community advisory group. More than 18,000 residents aged 18 and above from 19 different zip codes surrounding Marshfield, WI were invited to participate in Phase I. After providing written informed consent, participants completed brief questionnaires that included questions about demographics, some environmental exposures, family history of disease, and adverse drug reactions, as well as family members living in the area. Participants provided 50ml of blood from which DNA was extracted and plasma and serum samples were stored. The informed consent process allowed access to electronic medical records and included language about non-disclosure of personal research results. A tick-off box was included so that participants could either allow or decline subsequent recontact for future research studied. The objectives of Phase II are to create the phenotypic database, establish the scientific and administrative infrastructure to support genetic mapping of the DNA and the initial discovery projects and genotype a sufficient portion of the genetic material to support these discovery projects. The objectives of Phase III are to expand the discovery projects, complete the genotyping of the genetic database and expand physician/health care provider education and community consultation.  The Vanderbilt BioVU model uses discarded blood leftover from clinical care and de-identified clinical information, both of which are tracked with a Research Unique Identifier that is permanently disconnected from the medical record number used to generate it. The Vanderbilt IRB determined that the project does not qualify as "human subject" research under 46.102(f)(1)(2). The program has been reviewed by OHRP twice (the latest immediately prior to launch), and the determination of the Vanderbilt IRB that the project is consistent with the 8/10/2004 guidance has been validated. The model includes a simple opt out mechanism developed for patients who do not wish to have their samples included. Planning (including community involvement, ethics and IRB discussions, focus groups, development of operating procedures and pilot studies to assess them) began in May 2004, and the resource commenced sample collection in February 2007 and as of May 2009 contains approximately 56,000 samples. The current resource will be available to all Vanderbilt investigators who sign a Data Use Agreement. The resource represents Vanderbilt's broad patient population and thus provides a potential resource for research in a range of common and rare diseases as well as drug response or medication safety.  BioVU patient protection model: There has been extensive involvement by the ethics community and the IRB to put in place procedures to provide privacy protection. The overall protection plan is multifaceted and includes a combination of technology and policy: (1) creation of the SD described above; (2) return of only the specific clinical data items requested by investigators (rather than the complete de-identified chart); (3) submission of any specific proposed project to the IRB and to a separate protocol review committee, both of which must approve; (4) implementing a Data Use Agreement that permits only approved queries and data analyses, specifically prohibits attempts at re- identification (at the risk of institutional sanctions), and mandates redeposit of all genetic information generated in a research study back into a genomic database; and (5) tracking and auditing all use.    * Study Weblinks: [eMERGE][5]; [Group Health Center for Health Studies][6]; [Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation][7]; [Personalized Medicine Research Project][8]    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 3809  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=NHGRI_DAC_Supplemental_Instruction.pdf     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000234.v1.p1     [3]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [4]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=eMERGE_Acknowledgement.pdf     [5]: https://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/victr/dcc/projects/acc/index.php/About     [6]: http://www.centerforhealthstudies.org/     [7]: http://www.marshfieldclinic.org/     [8]: http://www.marshfieldclinic.org/pmrp  :::Case-Control::: 3809:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Patients were excluded if their physicians felt it was inappropriate for them to be involved the study (for example they were too ill), if dementia was diagnosed before January 1, 1987, or they had no memory problems.  **Adult Changes in Thought (ACT):**  Included a simple random sample of Seattle-area members of Group Health Cooperative enrollees who were 65 years or older and had either 1) a baseline Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) of value of at least 86 of 100 or 2) a baseline CASI of 80-86 who scored 86 or higher on retesting 2 months later and whose Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) score was normal, or 3) a baseline CASI less than 80 who on complete diagnostic evaluation did not meet clinical criteria for dementia.  Exclusion criteria included residents of a nursing home, participation in other studies, diagnosis of dementia, or 1) scoring 80-86 on the baseline CASI whose score remained low on retesting 2 months later, 2) scoring 80-86 on the baseline CASI with acquired cognitive impairment corroborated by the IQCODE and Blessed Dementia Rating Scale or no corroborating information available after a complete diagnostic evaluation and a consensus review ruled them ineligible. Living participants were also excluded if they did not provide consent to have their information submitted to dbGaP.  **Research Based Case Determination:**  In both ADRP and ACT research cohorts, the diagnosis of dementia was based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of mental disorders (ACT: IV; ADPR: III R) and the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease was based on the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke- Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) working group criteria. The dementia and Alzheimer's Disease research definitions are not applicable to the Marshfield and Vanderbilt participants.  **EMR Based Case Determination:**  For comparability with other eMERGE sites (Vanderbilt (n=272 cases) and Marshfield (n=224 cases)), study investigators also determined dementia status using a criterion based entirely on electronic medical records. The EMR derived definition can not be applied to the older GH ADPR cohort. Applying the automated algorithm to EMR data, dementia was defined as 5 occurrences of a dementia related ICD-9 code OR a prescription for a medication used to treat dementia. ICD-9 codes included Alzheimer's disease (331.0), senile dementia - uncomplicated (290.0), presenile dementia (290-10-290.13), senile dementia delusional [paranoid] features ( 290.20), senile dementia with depressive features ( 290.21), senile dementia with delirium or confusion (290.3), arteriosclerotic dementia (290.40-290.43), dementia due to alcohol (291.0-291.2), dementia due to drugs (292.82), dementia, unspecified (294.8), dementia not classified as senile, presenile, or arteriosclerotic (294.10-294.11), Pick's disease of the brain (331.11), other frontotemporal dementia (331.19), dementia with Lewy bodies (331.82). Prescription medications included donepezil, Aricept, galantamine, Razadyne, Reminyl, Nivalin, rivastigmine, Exelon, tacrine, Cognex, memantine, Namenda, Axura, Ebixa, and Akatinol.  :::Human660W-Quad_v1_A:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Dementia ][1]    * [ Alzheimer Disease ][2]    * [ Aging ][3]    * [ Aged ][4]    * [ Age Factors ][5]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68003704[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68000544[uid]     [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68000375[uid]     [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68000368[uid]     [5]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68000367[uid]  :::Study History   **Time line for Alzheimer Disease Patient Registry (ADPR):**  1986  The Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry (ADPR) was established  1987  The ADPR started enrolling cases of dementia and AD who came to medical attention  1996  ADPR enrollment stopped  **Time line for Adult Changes in Thought (ACT):**  1994 - 1996  ACT enrolled the original cohort of 2,581 dementia-free individuals  2000 - 2002  ACT enrolled an expansion cohort of 811 dementia-free individuals  2005  ACT began continuous enrollment of dementia-free individuals  **Time line for Vanderbilt's BioVU study:**  Feb 2007  Vanderbilt's BioVU became operational  May 2009  Electronic phenotype algorithm applied to BioVU and cases identified.  **Time line for Marshfield study:**  Sep 2002  Personalized Medicine Research Project (PMRP) launches recruitment.

phs000435.v2.p1::: Whole Exome Sequencing of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia:::Study Description   The somatic genetic basis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a common and clinically heterogenous adult leukemia, remains poorly understood. Massively parallel sequencing technology now provides a method for systematic discovery of genetic alterations that underlie disease, and for uncovering new therapeutic targets and biomarkers. We present a dataset consisting of DNA sequencing from 169 CLL samples (with matched germline controls). Samples were collected from patients displaying a wide range of characteristics representing the broad clinical spectrum of CLL.  Understanding the mutational landscape of CLL provides a starting point for systematic analyses to address fundamental questions in CLL, including how mutated genes alter cellular networks and phenotypes, and thereby contribute to disease heterogeneity.    * Study Types: Case Set, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 169  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal::: 169:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000001.v3.p1::: National Eye Institute (NEI) Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS):::Study Description   The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) was initially designed as a long- term multi-center, prospective study of the clinical course of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and age-related cataract. In addition to collecting natural history data, AREDS included a clinical trial of high-dose vitamin and mineral supplements for AMD and a clinical trial of high-dose vitamin supplements for cataract. AREDS participants were 55 to 80 years of age at enrollment and had to be free of any illness or condition that would make long-term follow-up or compliance with study medications unlikely or difficult. On the basis of fundus photographs graded by a central reading center, best-corrected visual acuity and ophthalmologic evaluations, 4,757 participants were enrolled in one of several AMD categories, including persons with no AMD.  The clinical trials for AMD and cataract were conducted concurrently. AREDS participants were followed on the clinical trials for a median time of 6.5 years. Subsequent to the conclusion of the clinical trials, participants were followed for an additional 5 years and natural history data were collected. The AREDS research design is detailed in AREDS Report 1. AREDS Report 8 contains the mainline results from the AMD trial; AREDS Report 9 contains the results of the cataract trial.  Blood samples were also collected from 3,700+ AREDS participants for genetic research. Genetic samples from 600 AREDS participants (200 controls, 200 Neovascular AMD cases, and 200 Geographic Atrophy cases) were selected using data available in March 2005 and then were evaluated with a genome-wide scan. These data, as well as selected phenotypic data, were made available in the dbGaP. DNA from AREDS participants, which is currently being stored in the AREDS Genetic Repository, is available for research purposes. However, not all of the 3,700+ AREDS participants who submitted a blood sample currently have DNA available.  In addition to including the data from the genome-wide scan on the 600 original samples, this second version of the AREDS dbGaP database provides a comprehensive set of data tables with extensive clinical information collected for the 4,757 participants who participated in AREDS. The tables include information collected at enrollment/baseline, during study follow-up, fundus and lens pathology, nutritional estimates, quality of life measures and measures of morbidity and mortality.  In November 2010, over 72,000 high quality fundus and lens photographs from 595 AREDS participants (of the original 600 selected for the genome-wide scan) were made available in the AREDS dbGaP. In addition to the genome-wide scan data, the fundus and lens grading data for these participants are also available in the AREDS dbGaP. Details about the ocular photographs that are available are found [here][1].  In January 2012, a measure of daily sunlight exposure was added in a separate "sunlight" table. Furthermore, the "followup" table has been revised. The visual acuity for the right eye was inadvertently missing at odd-numbered visits (01, 03, 05, etc.). This data is now part of the table.  It is hoped that this resource will better help researchers understand two important diseases that affect an aging population. These data may be applied to examination and inference on genetic and genetic-environmental bases for age-related diseases of public health significance and may also help elucidate the clinical course of both conditions, generate hypotheses, and aid in the design of clinical trials of preventive interventions.   > <p> <b>Definitions of Final AMD Phenotype Categories<b>  > Please see <a href="GetPdf.cgi?id=phd001138" target="_blank">phd001138.1<a> for a detailed description of how AREDS participants' final AMD phenotype was categorized.   > <p> <b>User&#39;s Guide for AREDS Phenotype Data<b>  > A detailed User&#39;s Guide for the AREDS phenotype data is available.

phs000258.v2.p1::: The Thrifty Microbiome: The Role of the Gut Microbiota in Obesity in the Amish:::Study Description   Emerging evidence that the gut microbiota may contribute in important ways to human health and disease has led us and others to hypothesize that both symbiotic and pathological relationships between gut microbes and their host may be key contributors to obesity and the metabolic complications of obesity. Our "Thrifty Microbiome Hypothesis" poses that gut microbiota play a key role in human energy homeostasis. Specifically, constituents of the gut microbial community may introduce a survival advantage to its host in times of nutrient scarcity, promoting positive energy balance by increasing efficiency of nutrient absorption and improving metabolic efficiency and energy storage. However, in the presence of excess nutrients, fat accretion and obesity may result, and in genetically predisposed individuals, increased fat mass may result in preferential abdominal obesity, ectopic fat deposition (liver, muscle), and metabolic complications of obesity (insulin resistance, hypertension, hyperlipidemia). Furthermore, in the presence of excess nutrients, a pathological transition of the gut microbial community may occur, causing leakage of bacterial products into the intestinal lymphatics and portal circulation, thereby inducing an inflammatory state, further aggravating metabolic syndrome traits and accelerating atherosclerosis. This pathological transition and the extent to which antimicrobial leakage occurs and causes inflammatory and other maladaptive sequelae of obesity may also be influenced by host factors, including genetics. In the proposed study, we will directly test the Thrifty Microbiome Hypothesis by performing detailed genomic and functional assessment of gut microbial communities in intensively phenotyped and genotyped human subjects before and after intentional manipulation of the gut microbiome. To address these hypotheses, five specific aims are proposed: (1) enroll three age- and sex-matched groups from the Old Order Amish: (i) 50 obese subjects (BMI > 30 kg/m2) with metabolic syndrome, (ii) 50 obese subjects (BMI > 30 kg/m2) without metabolic syndrome, and (iii) 50 non-obese subjects (BMI < 25 kg/m2) without metabolic syndrome and characterize the architecture of the gut microbiota from the subjects enrolled in this study by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes; (2) characterize the gene content (metagenome) to assess the metabolic potential of the gut microbiota in 75 subjects to determine whether particular genes or pathways are correlated with disease phenotype; (3) characterize the transcriptome in 75 subjects to determine whether differences in gene expression in the gut microbiota are correlated with disease phenotype, (4) determine the effect of manipulation of the gut microbiota with antibiotics on energy homeostasis, inflammation markers, and metabolic syndrome traits in 50 obese subjects with metabolic syndrome and (5) study the relationship between gut microbiota and metabolic and cardiovascular disease traits, weight change, and host genomics in 1,000 Amish already characterized for these traits and in whom 500K Affymetrix SNP chips have already been completed. These studies will provide our deepest understanding to date of the role of gut microbes in terms of 'who's there?', 'what are they doing?', and 'how are they influencing host energy homeostasis, obesity and its metabolic complications? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to unravel the contribution of the bacteria that normally inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract to the development of obesity, and its more severe metabolic consequences including cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and Type II diabetes. We will take a multidisciplinary approach to study changes in the structure and function of gut microbial communities in three sets of Old Order Amish patients from Lancaster, Pennsylvania: obese patients, obese patients with metabolic syndrome and non-obese individuals. The Old Order Amish are a genetically closed homogeneous Caucasian population of Central European ancestry ideal for genetic studies. These works have the potential to provide new mechanistic insights into the role of gut microflora in obesity and metabolic syndrome, a disease that is responsible for significant morbidity in the adult population, and may ultimately lead to novel approaches for prevention and treatment of this disorder.    * Study Type: Longitudinal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 404  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Longitudinal::: 404:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Inclusion criteria for this study are: (1) age > 20 years of age; (2) previously participated in a research study five or more years previously in which weight and MetS-defining traits were measured; and (3) was not on any medications that alter MetS traits at the time of initial study.

Excessive fat tissue, especially in and around the abdomen is associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its attendant features of dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, abnormalities in blood clotting, and elevated circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Great inter-individual variation is apparent in propensity toward obesity, location where excess fat is deposited, and the extent to which this results in adverse health outcomes. Comparison of gut microbiota in obese and lean mice and humans, suggest that the gut microbial communities may contribute to overall energy balance in man. To explore the possible dysbiosis of gut microbiota in obesity and its metabolic complications, we will study obese and non-obese Old Order Amish subjects. Using a number of approaches we will characterize the genomic architecture of the gut microbiota at baseline, and after manipulation with antibiotics, to access its role in energy homeostasis, inflammation, and MetS traits.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Claire Fraser-Liggett.

phs000003.v1.p1::: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Repository Parkinson&#39;s Disease Collection:::Study Description   The NINDS repository was established in October 2001 with the goal of developing standardized, broadly useful diagnostic and other clinical data, as well as a collection of DNA and cell line samples to further advance gene discovery of neurological disorders. All samples and both phenotypic and genotypic data are available to the research community including academic and industry scientists. This collection includes thousands of samples and associated phenotypic data sets from individuals with Parkinsonism, including Parkinson's disease (PD).  Epidemiological studies have shown an estimated cumulative prevalence of PD of greater than 1 per thousand. When prevalence is limited to senior populations, this proportion increases nearly 10-fold. The estimated genetic risk ratio for PD is approximately 1.7 (70% increased risk for PD if a sibling has PD) for all ages, and increases over 7-fold for those under age 66 years. The role for genes contributing to the risk of PD is therefore significant.  A subset of subjects from the collection of North American Caucasians with Parkinson's disease was utilized in the [NINDS Parkinson's Disease ][1] study.    * Study Weblink: [NINDS, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke][2]    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1283  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./study.cgi?id=phs000089     [2]: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/parkinsons_disease/parkinsons_disease.htm  :::Case Set::: 1283:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **UPDATE**  Summary level data for this study has been updated since its initial release at dbGaP.

phs000336.v1.p1::: A Genome-Wide Association Study of Lung Cancer Risk:::Study Description   Three genetic loci for lung cancer risk have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but inherited susceptibility to specific histologic types of lung cancer is not well established. We conducted a GWAS of lung cancer and its major histologic types genotyping 515,922 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 5,739 incident lung cancer cases and 5,848 controls from one population-based case-control study and three cohort studies. Results were combined with summary data from 10 additional studies for a total of 13,300 cases and 19,666 controls of European descent. Four studies also provided histology data for replication resulting in 3,333 adenocarcinomas (AD), 2,589 squamous cell carcinomas (SQ), and 1,418 small cell carcinomas (SC).  In analyses by histology, rs2736100 (_TERT_) on chromosome 5p15.33, was associated with risk of adenocarcinoma (OR=1.23, 95%CI=1.13-1.33, P=3.02x10-7), but not other histologic types (OR=1.01, P=0.84, and OR=1.00, P=0.93, for SQ and SC, respectively). This finding was confirmed in each replication study and overall meta-analysis (OR=1.24, 95%CI=1.17-1.31, P=3.74x10-14 for AD and OR=0.99, P=0.69 and OR=0.97, P=0.48, for SQ and SC, respectively). Other previously reported association signals on 15q25 and 6p21 were also refined, but no additional loci reached genome-wide significance. In conclusion, a lung cancer GWAS identified a distinct hereditary contribution to adenocarcinoma.  _Note: The lung study dataset to be released to dbGaP and caBIG excludes 47 individuals from the PLCO cohort who consented to participate only in cancer research projects and 22 individuals because of updated QC. Thus, the released dataset is derived from 11517 subjects, 5699 cases and 5818 controls. After the updated QC, the dataset to be released to dbGaP and caBIG includes 506062 SNPs._    * Study Weblinks: [The Environment and Genetics in Lung Cancer Etiology (EAGLE)][1]; [The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC)][2]; [The Prostate, Lung, Colon, Ovary Screening Trial (PLCO)][3]; [Cancer Prevention Study overview][4]; [Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) portal][5]; [Core Genotyping Facility (CGF)][6]; [CGF sample handling and quality control][7]; [dbGaP][8]; [EIGENSTRAT][9]; [ESPERR score][10]; [Genotype Library and Utilities (GLU)][11]; [Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)][12]; [SNP500Cancer][13]; [STRUCTURE][14]; [Tagzilla][15]    * Study Types: Case-Control, Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 11517  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://eagle.cancer.gov     [2]: http://atbcstudy.cancer.gov     [3]: http://prevention.cancer.gov/plco     [4]: http://www.cancer.org/docroot/RES/content/RES_6_2_Study_Overviews.asp     [5]: http://cgems.cancer.gov/     [6]: http://cgf.nci.nih.gov/     [7]: http://cgf.nci.nih.gov/operations/sample-handling.html     [8]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gap     [9]: http://genepath.med.harvard.edu/~reich/EIGENSTRAT.htm     [10]: http://genome.ucsc.edu     [11]: http://code.google.com/p/glu-genetics/     [12]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Omim/     [13]: http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov/     [14]: http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/structure.html     [15]: http://code.google.com/p/glu-genetics  :::Case-Control, Cohort::: 11517:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

We also conducted a meta-analysis of the NCI GWAS with summary data from ten additional studies, for a total of 13,300 primary lung cancer cases and 19,666 controls, all of European descent. Four of the ten studies provided information on histology for replication analyses; 3333 AD, 2589 SQ, and 1418 SC cases were analyzed overall.  The 11,587 subjects in the NCI GWAS were drawn from one population-based case- control study and three cohort studies; specifically: the Environment and Genetics in Lung Cancer Etiology (EAGLE), a population-based case-control study including 2100 primary lung cancer cases and 2120 healthy controls enrolled in Italy between 2002 and 2005; the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC), a randomized primary prevention trial including 29,133 male smokers enrolled in Finland between 1985 and 1993; the Prostate, Lung, Colon, Ovary Screening Trial (PLCO), a randomized trial including 150,000 individuals enrolled in ten U.S. study centers between 1992 and 2001; and the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort (CPS-II), including over 183,000 subjects enrolled by the American Cancer Society between 1992 and 2001 across all U.S. states. Analyses stratified by histology in the NCI GWAS included 1730 AD cases, 1400 SQ cases, 678 SC cases, and groups of other histological types or of mixed histologies. These studies were approved by the individual institutional review boards of each location, and each subject gave his or her informed consent for participation. In the PLCO study, 47 individuals gave permission to participate only in studies involving lung cancer, and thus have been excluded from the dataset released on dbGaP and caBIG.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigators **      * Maria Teresa Landi.

phs000267.v2.p2::: Autism Genome Project (AGP) Consortium - Whole Genome Association Study of over 1,500 Parent-Offspring Trios - Stage I and II:::Study Description   Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are highly heritable (~90%), yet the underlying genetic determinants are largely unknown. To understand the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity in ASDs, we analyzed over 1,500 strictly defined ASD families with over 1,000,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and applied multiple analytical strategies to examine these families for SNPs and Copy Number Variation (CNVs) affecting risk for ASDs. Secondary analyses examined associations in more homogenous subgroups. Furthermore, the use of large control datasets permitted contrasting case and control samples and addressed the potential increased burden of rare CNVs in ASD. Our data have allowed us to discern key features of the ASD genomic architecture, find new susceptibility loci, and chart a course for future studies in ASDs.    * Study Type: Parent-Offspring Trios    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 7880  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Parent-Offspring Trios::: 7880:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

In an ongoing effort, the international AGP Consortium is collecting ASD families for ongoing genetic studies. The first phase of this initiative involved examining genetic linkage and chromosomal rearrangements in 1,168 families having at least two ASD individuals (PMID: [17322880][1]). In this second phase of the project, we collected more families and genotyped them to examine for Copy Number Variation (CNVs) and SNPs affecting risk for ASD.  Affected subjects were grouped in three classes (strict, broad and spectrum ASD) based on proband diagnostic measures. To qualify for the strict class, affected individuals met criteria for autism on both primary instruments, the ADI-R and the ADOS. The broad class included individuals who met ADI-R criteria for autism and ADOS criteria for ASD, but not autism, or vice versa. ADI-R-based diagnostic classification of subjects as ASD followed criteria published by Risi et al. (PMID: [16926617][2]). Specifically, individuals who almost met ADI criteria for autism were classified as ASD if (1) they met criteria on social and either communication or repetitive behavior domains; or (2) met criteria on social and within 2 points of criteria for communication, or met criteria on communication and within 2 points of social criteria, or within 1 point on both social and communication domains4. Finally, the spectrum class included all individuals who were classified as ASD on both the ADI-R and ADOS or who were not evaluated on one of the instruments but were diagnosed with autism on the other instrument. Subjects from all classifications (strict, broad, and spectrum) were included in the CNV analysis.  Family-history reports were taken to inform on the family type. Multiplex (MPX) families had at least two individuals receiving validated ASDs diagnoses who were first to third degree relatives (for third degree, only considered cousins). This included families with affected dizygotic twins. Simplex (SPX) families had only one known individual with ASD in first to third (cousin) degree relatives. Families with only affected monozygotic twins were considered SPX. Unknown (UKN) families were any families that did not fall into the MPX or SPX criteria above. Given the international and multi-site nature of the project and range of chronological and mental age of the probands, a range of cognitive tests were administered, and standard scores were combined across tests to provide consolidated IQ estimates.

phs000390.v1.p1::: Genomic Wide Scans for Female Osteoporosis Genes:::Study Description   Osteoporosis is a condition of excessive skeletal fragility which results in high risk to low trauma fractures. It is the most prevalent metabolic bone disease and is a major public health problem which may result in devastating morbidity and mortality. The most powerful, measurable determinant of fracture risk is bone mineral density (BMD). More than 60% of BMD variation is attributable to genetic factors. There are gender differences in BMD that contribute to a substantially higher fracture risk among women than men. Genetic studies demonstrate that some osteoporosis risk genes/genomic regions are gender specific. However, specific such genes contributing to female BMD and to the sex differences of BMD are largely unknown.  Recent rapid progresses in SNP genotyping technology, in our knowledge about human genome diversity and linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in the human genome as revealed have made it feasible and timely to pursue a powerful whole genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genes for BMD. The major goal of this project is to perform a powerful GWAS study in a large sample of US Caucasian subjects. Gender specific effects of the genetic variants will be examined. The significant genetic variants discovered will be used to design diagnostic DNA chips for prognosis for potential health problems of osteoporosis later in life.    * Study Type: Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1617  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Cohort::: 1617:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000504.v1.p1::: Genomic Sequencing of Medulloblastoma:::Study Description   Medulloblastomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in children. Identifying and understanding the genetic events that drive these tumors is critical for the development of more effective diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies. Recently, our group and others described distinct molecular subtypes of medulloblastoma based on transcriptional and copy number profiles. Here, we utilized whole exome hybrid capture and Illumina sequencing to identify somatic mutations across the coding regions of 92 primary medulloblastoma/normal pairs. Overall, medulloblastomas exhibit low mutation rates consistent with other pediatric tumors, with a median of 0.35 non-silent mutations per megabase. We identified twelve genes mutated at statistically significant frequencies, including previously known mutated genes in medulloblastoma such as _CTNNB1_, _PTCH1_, _MLL2_, _SMARCA4_ and _TP53_. Recurrent somatic mutations were identified in an RNA helicase gene, _DDX3X_, often concurrent with _CTNNB1_ mutations, and in the nuclear co-repressor (N-CoR) complex genes _GPS2_, _BCOR_, and _LDB1_, to our knowledge novel findings in medulloblastoma and all cancer. We show that mutant _DDX3X_ potentiates transactivation of a TCF promoter and enhances cell viability in combination with mutant but not wild type beta-catenin. Together, our study reveals the alteration of Wnt, Hedgehog, histone methyltransferase and now _N- CoR_ pathways across medulloblastomas and nominates the RNA helicase _DDX3X_ as a component of pathogenic beta-catenin signaling in medulloblastoma.

phs000506.v1.p1::: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Multicenter Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Cohort Study (MACS):::Study Description   The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) is an ongoing prospective study of the natural and treated histories of HIV-1 infection in homosexual and bisexual men conducted by sites located in Baltimore, Chicago, Pittsburgh and Los Angeles. A total of 6,972 men have been enrolled. From April 1984 through March 1985, 4954 men were enrolled; an additional 668 men were enrolled from April 1987 through September 1991. A third enrollment of 1,350 men took place between October 2001 and August 2003. Of the 6,972 enrolled men, approximately 3,564 (51%) are infected with HIV. MACS is intended to evaluate predictors and outcomes of HIV infection and treatment with greater depth and breadth than that ascertained in standard clinical care. Towards this end, MACS participants have answered detailed questionnaires, donated samples and undergone testing, some contributing more than 30 years' worth of data. The MACS interview includes: behavior (particularly those related to HIV exposure), demographic and psychosocial characteristics, illicit drug use, physical symptoms, utilization of health services, a quality of life survey, a detailed assessment of antiretroviral medication and indication (prophylaxis and/or treatment). The standardized physical exam includes: a complete and standardized physical examination (i.e., standardized blood pressure, body habitus measures, neuropathy assessment), a neuropsychological screening and examination, and a range of substudy assessments of cardiovascular health, carotid IMT measurements, fMRI, kidney function tests among others. Blood samples have been collected at all visits for measurement of standard clinical measures and for novel tests of virology and immunology. Clinical outcomes were ascertained at each visit and when indicated confirmed by medical record abstraction. These outcomes include HIV seroconversion, cardiovascular/cerebrovascular and neurologic disease, renal and liver disease, lung infections, malignancies and mortality. Data are stored at the data center and clinical specimens (plasma, serum, cells, B-cell lines, PBMC pellets and urine) are collected at each visit and stored for future analysis.    * Study Weblink: [STATEPI][1]    * Study Types: Longitudinal, Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access:  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://statepi.jhsph.edu/index.html  :::Longitudinal, Cohort:::0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   No phenotype or molecular data available  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   Only men able to attend study visits in selected cities were eligible to attend. Men who have moved since enrollment have been retained and data collected as feasible. All men enrolled were likely to be men who have sex with men, based on the venues in which they were recruited, but MSM was not a requirement for enrollment in all enrollment waves. In the initial wave, MSM's without symptoms of AIDS as defined in 1983 were eligible. Subsequent enrollment waves have stratified by HIV status and age to ensure a balance of HIV positive and HIV negative controls across the life-span. Subsequent waves have also sought racial diversity and have targeted venues MSMs of color.  ::: :::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ][1]    * [ HIV Infections ][2]    * [ AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections ][3]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68000163[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68015658[uid]     [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68017088[uid]  ::: :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigators **      * Roger Detels, MD.

phs000290.v1.p1::: NHLBI GO-ESP: Lung Cohorts Exome Sequencing Project (Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension):::Study Description   The NHLBI "Grand Opportunity" Exome Sequencing Project (GO-ESP), a signature project of the NHLBI Recovery Act investment, was designed to identify genetic variants in coding regions (exons) of the human genome (the "exome") that are associated with heart, lung and blood diseases. These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied. These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease, contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention and treatments to specific populations. This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects. GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers - BroadGO and SeattleGO.  The syndrome of pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a pulmonary disease that carries very high morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a category of PH (WHO Group 1) that includes several entities (idiopathic or heritable PAH, and PAH associated with other diseases such as connective tissue diseases including scleroderma-associated PAH) and carries a dismal prognosis, in particular when it relates to scleroderma-associated PAH (median survival of about 4 years). It is believed that the severity of structural changes involving the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular failure are genetically determined. The 'Genomics and Genetics of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension' study at Johns Hopkins University aims to identify genetic determinants associated with risk of PAH in a cohort of European American and African American participants with and without PAH. The study also focuses on patients with scleroderma, who are further stratified according to those who have or do not have PAH. The broad goals of the Lung GO /ESP-GO falls into two general categories: (i) discovery of all variants (i.e., common and rare) in all protein-coding regions of the human genome (i.e., the exome) conferring risk to complex pulmonary diseases including PAH. The Johns Hopkins University PAH cohort offers a unique opportunity to elucidate genetic variants that cause PAH.    * Study Weblink: [NHLBI GO ESP Project][1]    * Study Types: Case-Control, Exome Sequencing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 96  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://esp.gs.washington.edu/drupal/  :::Case-Control, Exome Sequencing::: 96:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

For patients with scleroderma, the presence of disease is defined as systemic sclerosis with diffuse or limited scleroderma meeting the American College of Rheumatology criteria. Cases were included if they met clinical features that satisfied American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for a diagnosis of scleroderma or the presence of three of five features of the CREST syndrome were identified; or there was the presence of definite Raynaud's phenomenon, abnormal nail fold capillaries typical of scleroderma and the presence of a specific scleroderma related auto-antibody. Limited skin involvement was defined as skin tightening distal to elbows and knees with or without facial involvement; and diffuse skin involvement, tightening proximal to these joints or truncal involvement; age >18 years; ability and willingness to provide informed consent.  **Additional inclusion criteria for patients enrolled for studies included:**    1. Subjects older than 18 years of age with a diagnosis of PAH-SSc.    2. Subjects were NYHA functional class II or III.    3. A right heart catheterization done prior to initiation of bosentan therapy with a mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP)  25mmHg, pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP)  15mmHg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) 3 Woods units.    4. 6MWD  100 meters and  500 meters at screening and baseline.    5. Negative urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing age at screening and baseline visits.    6. Written informed consent.  **Exclusion Criteria:** Patients were excluded if their right heart catheterization reveals evidence of pulmonary venous hypertension (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure > 15 mm Hg), or if they have significant chronic obstructive or interstitial lung disease, portal hypertension, or severe obstructive sleep apnea, or chronic thromboembolic disease. Chronic obstructive lung disease is defined as a forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced expiratory volume ratio < 70% and a forced expiratory volume in 1 second less than 60% of predicted. Interstitial lung disease is defined based on a combination of pulmonary function tests and chest radiography. Patients with moderate to severe pulmonary fibrosis will be excluded by the following criteria: Patients will be excluded if they have a total lung capacity less than 60% of predicted and included if the total lung capacity was  70%. Patients with a total lung capacity between 60 and 70% of predicted were included if their computed tomography scan demonstrates only minimal interstitial fibrosis. Patients were excluded if they were positive for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus, had a history of anorexigen use including phen-fen, or any other disease known to be associated with pulmonary hypertension.  **Additional exclusion criteria for patients enrolled for studies included:**    1. Subjects with other etiology for pulmonary hypertension besides PAH-SSc.    2. Subjects with liver function abnormalities (ALT or AST > 1.5 times the upper limit of normal at screening or at baseline) or chronic liver disease.    3. Acute decompensation of underlying illness of hospitalization for pulmonary hypertension within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.    4. Prior therapy with bosentan, sildenafil, or prostacyclin analogue.    5. History of hypersensitivity reaction or adverse effect related to sildenafil or bosentan.    6.

phs000364.v1.p1::: High density copy number analysis and whole exome sequencing of chronic lymphocytic leukemia:::Study Description   The pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common leukemia in adults, is still largely unknown since the full spectrum of genetic lesions that are present in the CLL genome, and therefore the number and identity of dysregulated cellular pathways, have not been identified. By combining next-generation sequencing and copy number analysis, we show here that the typical CLL coding genome contains less than 20 clonally represented gene alterations/case, including predominantly non-silent mutations and fewer copy number aberrations. These analyses led to the discovery of several genes not previously known to be altered in CLL. While most of these genes were affected at low frequency in an expanded CLL screening cohort, mutational activation of NOTCH1, observed in 8.3% of CLL at diagnosis, was detected at significantly higher frequency during disease progression toward Richter transformation (31.0%) as well as in chemorefractory CLL (20.8%). Consistent with the association of NOTCH1 mutations with clinically aggressive forms of the disease, NOTCH1 activation at CLL diagnosis emerged as an independent predictor of poor survival. These results provide initial data on the complexity of the CLL coding genome and identify a dysregulated pathway of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance.    * Study Types: Exome Sequencing, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 5  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Exome Sequencing, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal::: 5:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000344.v1.p1::: Genome-Wide Association Study of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Finland:::Study Description   The genetic etiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is not well understood. Finland has one of the highest incidence of ALS in the world, making it an ideal population for study. To identify genetic risk factors for this fatal neurodegenerative disease, we undertook a genome-wide association study of 405 Finnish patients diagnosed with ALS and 497 Finnish controls. Two loci that exceeded the Bonferroni threshold for genome-wide significance were identified. One was located on chromosome 21q22, corresponding to the known autosomal recessive D90A allele of the SOD1 gene. The other was detected on the short arm of chromosome 9, which had been previously identified in linkage studies of families with ALS. Together, these two loci account for most of the increased incidence of ALS observed in this population.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 896  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 896:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000559.v1.p1::: Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE): Epidemiologic Architecture for Genes Linked to Environment (EAGLE) - BioVU Cancer Project:::Study Description   As part of Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology PAGE study (Phase I), the Epidemiologic Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (EAGLE I) project accessed both epidemiologic- and clinic-based collections. The epidemiologic-based collection of EAGLE I included the National Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys (NHANES), ascertained between 1991-1994 (NHANES III), 1999-2002, and 2007-2008. NHANES is a population-based cross- sectional survey now conducted every year in the United States to assess the health status of Americans at the time of ascertainment and to assess trends over the years of survey. Genetic NHANES consists of 19,613 DNA samples linked to thousands of variables including demographics, health and lifestyle variables, physical examination variables, laboratory variables, and exposures. NHANES is diverse with almost one-half of the samples (46.4%) coming from self-reported Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic blacks. In contrast to NHANES, BioVU is a clinic-based collection of >150,000 DNA samples from Vanderbilt University Medical Center linked to de-identified electronic medical records (EMRs). Approximately 12% of BioVU's overall DNA sample collection is from African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients.  The overall goals of PAGE I and EAGLE I were broad and several-fold:    1. Replicate genome-wide association study (GWAS)- identified variants in European Americans;    2. Identify population-specific and trans-population genotype-phenotype associations;    3. Identify genetic and environmental modifiers of these associations.  NHANES is an excellent resource for the study of quantitative traits associated with common human diseases. However, given that the age range of NHANES spans childhood to late adulthood and not all diseases are surveyed, NHANES is less useful for the study of adult-onset diseases such as major cancers. Therefore, under American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding, EAGLE as part of PAGE I defined eight major cancers sites for genetic analysis in BioVU, Vanderbilt's biorepository linked to de-identified EMRs. The eight major cancers defined for this study included melanoma, breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, lung, endometrial, and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Cancer cases were defined using a combination of ICD-9 codes and tumor registry entries. Controls include BioVU participants without cancer and encompassing the age and gender distributions of cancer cases. Targeted genotyping of GWAS-identified variants for these diseases (124 SNPs) and ancestry informative markers (128 AIMs) was performed by the Center for Human Genetics Research Vanderbilt DNA Resources Core.

A combination of the tumor registry data, along with ICD-9 billing codes, procedure codes, vital signs, and free text clinical notes, were used to identify cases for eight cancers among all patients aged 18 or greater in the SD with DNA samples using the following algorithms:    * Breast cancer: Three or more mentions of ICD-9 primary code for malignant neoplasm of the female breast and all sub-codes on separate clinic visits OR a tumor registry entry for breast cancer AND female;    * Colorectal cancer: Tumor registry entry for colorectal cancer;    * Endometrial cancer: Tumor registry entry for endometrial cancer AND histology AND female;    * Lung cancer: Tumor registry entry for lung cancer, any location and any type;    * Melanoma: Three or more mentions of ICD-9 codes for malignant melanoma of skin OR tumor registry entry for melanoma;    * Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: Tumor registry entry for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with histology;    * Ovarian cancer: Tumor registry entry for ovarian cancer AND female;    * Prostate cancer: Three or more mentions of ICD-9 codes for malignant neoplasm of prostate OR tumor registry entry for prostate cancer.  Approximately two control samples were identified per case. Controls were matched by sex, race/ethnicity (administratively assigned), and age (within five years of the cases). Controls were required to have at least two clinical narratives, with preference given to records with at least one fully documented history and physical. Exclusion criteria included records with one or more codes for neoplasms, records with a tumor registry entry, and records that had one or more cancer related keywords in the problem list.  Additional control criteria are as follows:    * Breast cancer controls are female only. For women over 40 years of age, we required that records contain at least one mammography Bi-Rad score as 1 (negative) or 2 (benign);    * Endometrial cancer controls are female only;    * Ovarian cancer controls are female only;    * For colorectal cancer controls, we required for patients over 50 years of age the keyword "colonoscopy" in the problem list OR a procedure code for colonoscopy;    * Prostate cancer controls are male only. For male controls aged 40 years and greater to have at least one prostate specific antigen (PSA) level <4 and that the most recent PSA level is within the normal range.  A total of 7,348 cases of cancer were identified in BioVU for targeted genotyping in EAGLE (Table).  **Table. Case counts by cancer and race/ethnicity.** Cases of specific cancers were determined in the de-identified electronic medical records within BioVU using algorithms implemented in late 2010/early 2011 as described in the text.

We used random-effects pooled analysis to test for association in the overall study population and in subgroups of subjects with childhood-onset asthma (defined as asthma developing before 16 years of age), later-onset asthma, severe asthma, and occupational asthma.    * Study Weblink: [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000077][1]    * Study Type: GWAS    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access:  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000077  :::GWAS:::0::: ::: :::Human610_Quadv1_B::: ::: ::: 
phs000251.v1.p1::: Human Microbiome Demonstration Project (UH2): Evaluation of the Cutaneous Microbiome in Psoriasis:::Study Description   Psoriasis, a highly prevalent disease of humans of unknown cause, is a chronic inflammatory disorder primarily involving skin, with distinctive clinical characteristics. With the newly developed tools that facilitate microbiome research, it now is possible to assess whether the cutaneous microbiome plays a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Preliminary data from our studies suggest that the cutaneous microbiome in psoriasis is complex and possibly different from normal. To deal with this complexity, we propose to examine the cutaneous microbiome in relation to psoriasis with explorations at several taxonomic and informatic levels. Our overall objective is to examine how changes in the normal cutaneous microbiome contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Since causality is complex and often difficult to prove, and beyond the scope of this RFP, our overall hypothesis is that there are alterations in the cutaneous microbiome in areas of skin affected by psoriasis in comparison with the range observed in clinically unaffected areas, or in healthy persons. We also hypothesize that the characteristics of the microbiome may affect clinical responses to the immunomodulatory agents used to treat psoriasis. An alternative hypothesis is that effective treatment of psoriasis with systemic immunomodulatory agents will not substantially affect the disordered microbial ecosystem. Such observations would provide evidence for the roles of the microbiota in this disorder. Since an important consideration in microbiome research is the optimal level (e.g. phylum, genus, species, strain, gene) at which to examine a scientific question, and we are not yet certain what are the optimal levels for psoriasis, this also will be examined. Our studies of psoriasis should allow development of both approaches and tools that will have general utility for Microbiome research. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1) To understand the cutaneous microbiome species composition overlaying psoriatic lesions; 2) To investigate differences in metagenome content for psoriatic lesions compared to normal skin; 3) To identify differences in the transcriptional profiles of the microbiome and the host between normal skin and psoriatic lesions using high-throughput sequencing; and 4. To estimate the effects of systemic immunomodulatory therapy for psoriasis on microbiome composition. In total, these studies should help us understand the role of the microbiome in psoriasis pathogenesis.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 93  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 93:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Subjects will be enrolled from the NYU Skin and Cancer Clinic, under the direction of Dr. Bruce Strober. Dr. Strober has focused his clinical practice and academic efforts on psoriasis for six years, and Dr. Seth Orlow, Chair of the Department of Dermatology, already has given his strong support to the project. The proposed studies already have been vetted and approved by the NYULMC IRB. When an individual chooses to participate in this study, the informed consent process will be undertaken by the Clinical Coordinator. Subjects will be given a unique study number specific to the Program. After establishing and signing informed consent, subjects will be given an appointment for baseline examinations. Depending on the component protocols at the enrollment stage, psoriasis patients and controls will be frequency matched on gender, ethnicity, and age group to increase the efficiency of the study to control for potential confounding due to demographic and lifestyle variables.  A pre-screening questionnaire will be utilized prior to scheduling the Screening Visit in order to screen out potential ineligible subjects by history.  **Inclusion Criteria:** In order to be eligible for participation in this study, subjects must meet the following criteria:    * Eligible subjects will be people who have moderate to severe psoriasis and who are candidates for either UV phototherapy or systemic therapies for psoriasis.    * Male or female subjects 18 years of age, but not more than 75 years of age at the time of enrollment.    * Must be able to provide signed and dated informed consent.    * Healthy subjects willing and able to provide skin specimens.  **Exclusion Criteria:** Any subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:    * Body Mass Index greater than or equal to 35 or less than or equal to 18.    * Vital signs outside of acceptable range at Screening Visit, i.e., blood pressure >140/90, oral temperature >100F, pulse >100.    * Use of any of the following drugs within the last month:      * systemic antibiotics (intravenous, intramuscular, or oral);      * oral, intravenous, intramuscular, nasal or inhaled corticosteroids;      * cytokines; methotrexate or immunosuppressive cytotoxic agents;      * large doses of commercial probiotics consumed (greater than or equal to 108 cfu or organisms per day) - includes tablets, capsules, lozenges, chewing gum or powders in which probiotic is a primary component. Ordinary dietary components such as fermented beverages/milks, yogurts, foods do not apply.    * Use of topical antibiotics or topical steroids on the face, scalp, or neck or on arms, forearms, or hands within the previous 7 days.  :::454 GS FLX Titanium:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Psoriasis ][1]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68011565[uid]  :::Study History   **Psoriasis: clinical features and course.** The initial lesions of psoriasis often appear gradually. The natural history of psoriasis following initial symptoms includes unpredictable exacerbations and remissions, but no long- lasting freedom from disease (1, 2). After the initial presentation, the disease usually consolidates into a chronic condition that sometimes varies in intensity depending on season, worsening flares in colder, drier months, and the presence of concomitant infections. Specific drugs (lithium, beta- blockers, alcohol, and withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids) may cause exacerbations of disease (3). There are different types of psoriasis (2, 4). Chronic plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris [PV]), the most common form, is marked by relatively static, thick, erythematous plaques with overlying scale, that may bleed if removed (Auspitz sign). Although the plaques of psoriasis can appear anywhere on the skin, including trunk, extremities, genitals, and face, the most commonly affected areas are the elbows and knees, lower back, and scalp (5).  Other forms of psoriasis include **pustular psoriasis**, an acute generalized eruption of sterile pustules that may be accompanied by fever, lymphocytosis, hypocalcemia, and hypoalbuminemia. Pustular psoriasis may be limited to the hands and fingers or the palms and soles. This form also appears during pregnancy (referred to as "impetigo herpetiformis"). **Guttate psoriasis** is characterized by small psoriatic papules and plaques (0.5-1.5 cm) distributed diffusely over the trunk and proximal extremities. Streptococcal pharyngitis often precedes guttate psoriasis, which commonly occurs in children and adolescents. **Erythrodermic psoriasis** is characterized by large erythematous patches (involving > 2/3 of the body surface area) without much overlying scale. Both the plaque and pustular psoriasis variants may progress to this more severe form of the disease. Psoriasis may be associated with both nail disease (onychodystrophy) and arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis involves asymmetrical joints including the vertebral and sacroiliac joints. Psoriasis may be related to Reiter's syndrome, a post-infectious disease constellation characterized by urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis. The frequency of inflammatory bowel disease is higher in patients with psoriasis, and many patients with psoriatic arthritis have asymptomatic bowel inflammation. Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus all are more common in psoriatic patients (6).  The lesions of psoriasis display several primary features: (i) **keratinocyte hyperplasia**, characterized by thickening of the epidermis (acanthosis) and downward expansion of the rete pegs, and associated with multiple overlying layers of scale (parakeratosis), and loss of the highest (granular) layer of the epidermis; (ii) **inflammation**, characterized by infiltrating neutrophils within the epidermis and in the scaly layer, and lymphocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells (DC) in the dermis and epidermis; and (iii) **ectatic blood vessels**, scattered in the upper layers of the dermis (creating telangiectasias within the papillary tips).  **Summary of the pathophysiology of psoriasis.** Psoriasis is characterized by immune dysregulation within the skin, with the appearance of cutaneous autoreactive T cells (Th1) producing IFN- and TNF- (2). Induction of an inflammatory milieu accelerates keratinocyte proliferation, leading to the development of epidermal hyperplasia (hyperkeratosis) and angiogenic tissue reactions, progressing to the increased skin vascularization and inflammatory cellular infiltrates that are the hallmarks of the psoriatic lesion. Normal skin contains both T lymphocytes and dendritic cells (7, 8) indicating a potential for triggering of recall immune responses to environmental agents. The lesions of psoriasis vulgaris contain large populations of leukocytes in addition to T cells and DCs, suggesting a function similar to organized lymphoid tissue that perpetuates immune infiltrates in psoriatic plagues. There is no good animal model for psoriasis; mouse and human skin are substantially different. Although some of the features of psoriasis (e.g. keritinocyte hyperplasia)can be obtained in transgenic or knock-out mice, the phenotypes include features of other dermatoses and neonatal lethality, which are not normally associated with human psoriasis (2). Thus, humans are the best experimental subjects in whom to study psoriasis. The availability of effective, systemic immunomodulatory agents in recent years has added resources for understanding pathogenesis (2, 3, 9, 10).  Th1 T cell-inducing cytokines from dendritic cells (DC) drive the Th1 response observed in psoriasis, and thus are prime targets for disease control with anti-cytokine reagents (11). IL-12 and IL-23 are related molecules sharing a common p40 chain. Whereas IL-12 induces IFN- and TNF-, IL-23 induces IL-17 (12), TNF-, and IL-6; both play important roles in the psoriatic inflammatory response. IL-12/IL-23 production by cutaneous DC, and thus to Th1-driven inflammation, may be due to Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation in the psoriatic lesions (via NF-kB stimulation). The role of TLRs in recognizing microbes implies a possible pathway for microbial involvement, at least in the final steps of psoriatic inflammation. The formation of a psoriatic plaque requires the continued presence of activated T cells specific for an unknown inciting antigen, and persistent T cell expression of plaque-inducing cytokines or cell-surface factors that form a "cytokine network." Thus, by the release of specific cytokines that act as growth factors or by cell-to-cell interactions, activated intra-dermal T cells trigger keratinocyte hyperproliferation. Subsequently, cytokines produced by stimulated nonlymphoid cells in the skin, such as keratinocyte-derived IL-8, chemotactic for neutrophils, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), inducing the proliferation of the dermal vasculature, contribute to the inflammatory process. The triggers that initiate the inflammatory pathways are unknown, however, immunomodulatory agents are effective therapies (3, 9, 13).  **Small subunit ribosomal RNA diversity.** Investigation of ssrRNA gene sequences has revolutionized the study of microbial ecology, leading to fundamental new insights into the diversity present in the prokaryotic world. Further, it has underscored the major difference between the numbers of microbes cultured in the laboratory versus those present in the environment; thus, it has become a well-accepted method for interrogating diversity in environmental samples (14, 15). Diversity measurements using ssrRNA analyses have become an important complement to whole community or metagenomic sequencing. New approaches are constantly being developed to address diversity questions with respect to microbial communities, by focusing on the regions of the ribosomal operons that have the highest information content (see for example 16-19).  Molecular analysis of the human microbiome has great potential (20-23). It has focused on fecal samples from the human GI tract (24) at the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI), and other centers (25-28), and in relation to disease (29, 30). Such studies have highlighted the extent of diversity associated with the human body. Other studies of the human Microbiome have focused on the oral cavity (31), upper gastrointestinal tract (32, 33), vagina (34-36), and on the skin (29, 37-41). Previous studies using ssrRNA approaches to study the diversity of the skin microbiome indicate that a community of microorganisms is consistently associated with the skin and is dominated by a median level of ~30-50 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from the bacterial domain in individual hosts at any time in a single site (37). In total, based on previous studies, >400 OTUs are predicted for superficial skin. The metabolic potential of these microbes has not been well-studied despite their fundamental importance to health and disease states of skin. Molecular studies of the fungal biota of the skin are in their infancy (99-41), but also are based on SSU sequences, especially the ITS1 and ITS2 loci (42-44).  Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause affecting 3% of the U.S. population. Its cause is unknown but there is evidence for extensive immune dysregulation. The role of the cutaneous microbiota in psoriasis has not been extensively examined which is surprising based on the evidence for inflammatory changes in tissues. Important questions that can be addressed by the proposed work include: Addressing such questions should enhance our knowledge about the diagnosis, prevention, natural history, and treatment of psoriasis.    1. Are there organisms whose presence or absence is a marker for psoriasis?    2. Could a host's status with respect to an organism reflect propensity to develop psoriasis?    3. Could specific organisms or their metabolic pathways correlate with psoriasis risk, and possibly explain the altered immunity?    4. Since immunomodulatory therapy is not always successful, could the nature of the microbiota be a predictor for treatment success or failure?    5. Will treatment of psoriasis with systemic therapy clear any abnormal microbiota, or do the abnormalities persist, suggesting a primary microbiological role in the disease?  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Martin J.

phs000005.v1.p1::: The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Human Genetics Resource Center: DNA and Cell Line Repository (the NINDS Repository): Cerebrovascular Disease/Stroke Study:::Study Description   The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Human Genetics Resource Center: DNA and Cell Line Repository ([the NINDS Repository)][1], banks phenotypic data and biological samples, including from individuals with cerebrovascular disease, in order to facilitate gene discovery in neurological disorders. Those samples are used in a number of studies, and genotyping data from studies using this resource are encouraged to be shared via dbGaP. Many studies have already shared data in this fashion, which in turn, can be linked back to the biologicals banked at the NINDS Repository.  Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States, and is an acute neurological event leading to death of neural tissues. Although the majority of strokes are ischemic strokes, meaning there is oxygen deprivation to the brain, almost 20% of strokes are hemorrhagic, resulting from bleeding into the brain. Samples available in [cerebrovascular disease][2] in the NINDS Repository, include but are not limited to those from individuals affected with the following: ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial aneurysm (both ruptured and unruptured), transient ischemic attack, arteriovenous malformations, and others. Many studies contribute to the NINDS Repository collection in an ongoing manner and others are being added regularly. These studies include samples from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) study, the Ischemic Stroke Genetics Study (ISGS), the Familial Intracranial Aneurysm study, and many others.  There is also an associated Control collection (see [dbGaP][3] and [ Coriell][4]). Others studies may use cases from the NINDS repository, controls from the NINDS repository, as well as cases, and controls, from other sources.

Because these include multiple clinically relevant subgroups, the appropriate phenotyping approach is not yet known. Many systems have been devised for the classification of ischemic stroke, including the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria (Adams et al., _Stroke_ 1993). The TOAST criteria include five subtypes: 1) large-artery atherosclerosis, 2) cardioembolism, 3) small- vessel occlusion, 4) stroke of other determined etiology, and 5) stroke of undetermined etiology.  Please note that this description is of cases with Cerebrovascular disease (including stroke) from the NINDS Repository collection. However, many studies utilize one or more of the following in combination: cases from this NINDS Repository collection, cases from other sources, controls form the NINDS repository, controls from other sources. For more specifics regarding this, please see the specific sub-study or related study description.

phs000289.v2.p1::: National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) GENEVA Genome-Wide Association Study of Venous Thrombosis (GWAS of VTE):::Study Description   ** Important Links and Information **    * [Instructions][1] to request Authorized Access    * [Data Use Certification Agreement][2]    * [Apply for Authorized Access ][3]  **Overview:**  > <u>Our overall long-term goal is to determine risk factors for the complex (multifactorial) disease, venous thromboembolism (<b>VTE<b>), that will allow physicians to stratify individual patient risk and target VTE prophylaxis to those who would benefit most._ In this genome-wide association case-control study (1300 cases and 1300 controls) we hope to identify susceptibility variants for VTE.  Mutations within genes encoding for important components of the anticoagulant, procoagulant, fibrinolytic, and innate immunity pathways are risk factors for VTE. We hypothesize that other genes within these four pathways or within other pathways also are VTE disease-susceptibility genes. Therefore, we performed a genome wide association (GWA) screen and analysis using the Illumina 660W platform to identify SNPs within 1,300 clinic-based, non-cancer VTE cases primarily from Minnesota and the upper Midwest USA, and 1300 clinic- based, unrelated controls frequency-matched on patient age, gender, myocardial infarction/stroke status and state of residence.  This is a subset of a slightly larger candidate gene study using 1500 case- control pairs to identify haplotype-tagging SNPs (**ht**-SNPs) in a large set of candidate genes (n~750) within the anticoagulant, procoagulant, fibrinolytic, and innate immunity pathways.  **Study Populations.**  > <b><u>Cases<u>.** VTE cases were consecutive Mayo Clinic outpatients with objectively-diagnosed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) residing in the upper Midwest and referred by Mayo Clinic physician to the Mayo Clinic Special Coagulation Laboratory for clinical diagnostic testing to evaluate for an acquired or inherited thrombophilia, or to the Mayo Clinic Thrombophilia Center. Any person contacted to be a control but discovered to have had a VTE was evaluated for inclusion as a case. Cases were primarily residents from Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan, Illinois, North or South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri and Indiana. A DVT or PE was categorized as objectively diagnosed when (a) confirmed by venography or pulmonary angiography, or pathology examination of thrombus removed at surgery, or (b) if at least one non-invasive test (compression duplex ultrasonography, lung scan, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging) was positive. A VTE was defined as:    1. Proximal leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which includes the common iliac, internal iliac, external iliac, common femoral, superficial [now termed "femoral"] femoral, deep femoral [sometimes referred to as "profunda" femoral] and/or popliteal veins. (Note: greater and lesser saphenous veins, or other superficial or perforator veins, were not included as proximal or distal leg DVT).    2. Distal leg DVT (or "isolated calf DVT"), which includes the anterior tibial, posterior tibial and/or peroneal veins. (Note: gastrocnemius, soleal and/or sural [e.g., "deep muscular veins" of the calf] vein thrombosis was not included as distal leg DVT).    3. Arm DVT, which includes the axillary, subclavian and/or innominate (brachiocephalic) veins. (Note: jugular [internal or external], cephalic and brachial vein thrombosis was not included in "arm DVT").    4. Hepatic, portal, splenic, superior or inferior mesenteric, and/or renal vein thrombosis. (Note: ovarian, testicular, peri-prostatic and/or pelvic vein thrombosis was not included).    5. Cerebral vein thrombosis (includes cerebral or dural sinus or vein, saggital sinus or vein, and/or transverse sinus or vein thrombosis).    6. Inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis    7. Superior vena cava (SVC) thrombosis    8. Pulmonary embolism  Patients with VTE related to active cancer, antiphospholipid syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis, a rheumatoid or other autoimmune disorder, a vascular anomaly (e.g., Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, etc.), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, or a mechanical cause for DVT (e.g., arm DVT or SVC thrombosis related to a central venous catheter or transvenous pacemaker, portal and/or splenic vein thrombosis related to liver cirrhosis, IVC thrombosis related to retroperitoneal fibrosis, etc.), with hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula thrombosis, or with prior liver or bone marrow transplantation were excluded.  **_Controls_.** A Mayo Clinic outpatient control group was prospectively recruited for this study. Controls were frequency-matched on the age group (18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and 80+ years), sex, myocardial infarction/stroke status, and state of residence distribution of the cases. We selected clinic-based controls using a controls' database of persons undergoing general medical examinations in the Mayo Clinic Departments of General Internal Medicine or Primary Care Internal Medicine. Additionally persons undergoing evaluation at the Mayo Clinic Sports Medicine Center, and the Department of Family Medicine were screened for inclusion as controls.  This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [http://www.genevastudy.org][4]) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to venous thrombosis through large-scale genome-wide association studies of 1,300 clinic-based, VTE cases and 1300 clinic-based, unrelated controls. Genotyping was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). Data cleaning and harmonization were done at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 2597  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=NHGRI_DAC_Supplemental_Instruction.pdf     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000289.v2.p1     [3]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [4]: http://www.genevastudy.org  :::Case-Control::: 2597:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

[1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000144  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   Purified DNA from several hundred biopsy samples were provided by pathology laboratories at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and Washington University's Siteman Cancer Center. The three sequencing centers then evaluated the sample DNAs and subsequently developed a "gold set" of 188 tumor DNAs for sequencing. DNA from matched normal tissues samples was also prepared.  Three different types of samples were then obtained from each original sample that was to be included in the "gold set": native DNA from the tumor sample, whole genome amplified (WGA) DNA from the tumor samples and native DNA from the normal tissue. Each sample was then analyzed by high-density genotyping using Affymetrix 500K SNP arrays.  To confirm tumor purity, data from the SNP arrays were used in two ways: to look for LOH over a minimum of one chromosomal arm and to look at overall copy number changes by performing histogram analysis. The second analysis was a straightforward test that confirmed that genotypes are identical between each sample derivative, and that sample mix up or gross error in whole genome amplification did not occur. Samples included in the "gold set" needed to have near perfect concordance of genotypes between the amplified and unamplified DNA and perfect concordance of genotypes (in the majority of the genome that did not undergo loss in the tumors) between the tumor and normal sample. In total, of the 528 samples that were genotyping using the SNP arrays, 188 of them were included in the "gold set" for sequencing among the three centers. Each of the 188 primary lung adenocarcinomas contained a minimum of 70% tumor cells as determined by pathologists.  All patients were properly consented using consent forms approved by each Institutional Review Board at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center, and Washington University's Siteman Cancer Center.  :::Mapping250K_Nsp;Mapping250K_Sty:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Neoplasms ][1]    * [ Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung ][2]    * [ Lung Neoplasms ][3]    * [ Adenocarcinoma ][4]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68009369[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68002289[uid]     [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68008175[uid]     [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68000230[uid]  :::Study History   **TSP Timeline**  > <ul> <li>August 2005 - TSP Part A study begins.<li>  * December 2007 - publication of copy number variation results from 371 lung adenocarcinoma samples.  * July 2008 - end of TSP Part A to examine copy number variation and mutations in 623 genes in 188 lung adenocarcinoma genomes.  * February 2008 - TSP Part B study begins.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Co-Investigators **      * TSP Consortium.

Eight years agoWe are a part of NHGRI's _**e**_lectronic _**M**_edical _**R**_ecords and _**Ge**_nomics (eMERGE) Network, whose goal is to conduct genome-wide association studies in thousands of individuals using EMR-derived phenotypes and DNA from linked biorepositories. For eMERGE, Northwestern University (NU) is studying type 2 diabetes as a phenotype. In addition, in order to explore race differences in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, NU collaborated with Vanderbilt University to study a mix of both Caucasian and African-Americans.  **Northwestern University**: In 2002, Northwestern committed to the development of a DNA repository to serve as a platform for the identification and validation of genotype-phenotype associations that will impact healthcare. The NUgene Project is a repository with longitudinal medical information from participating patients at affiliated hospitals and outpatient clinics from the Northwestern University Medical Center. Participants' DNA samples are coupled with data from a questionnaire (2 versions were used, 1 before and 1 after February 2006, both are included) and continuously updated data from our Electronic Medical Record (EMR) representing actual clinical care events. Northwestern has a state-of-the art, comprehensive inpatient and outpatient EMR system of over 2 million patients. NUgene has broad access to participant data for all outpatient visits as well as inpatient data via a consolidated data warehouse. NUgene participants consent to distribution and use of their coded DNA samples and data for a broad range of genetic research by third- party investigators.  **Vanderbilt University**: BioVU, Vanderbilt's DNA databank, is an enabling resource for exploration of the relationships among genetic variation, disease susceptibility, and variable drug responses, and represents a key first step in moving the emerging sciences of genomics and pharmacogenomics from research tools to clinical practice. BioVU acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care. The biobank is linked to de-identified clinical data extracted from Vanderbilt's EMR, which forms the basis for phenotype definitions used in genotype-phenotype correlations.    * Study Weblinks: [The eMERGE Network][5]; [NUgene][6]    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 3563  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=NHGRI_DAC_Supplemental_Instruction.pdf     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000237.v1.p1     [3]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [4]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=eMERGE_Acknowledgement.pdf     [5]: https://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/victr/dcc/projects/acc/index.php/Main_Page     [6]: https://www.nugene.org/  :::Case-Control::: 3563:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

By doing this, a potential source of bias has been introduced in that type 2 diabetic subjects who are treated with insulin alone have been excluded, although diabetic subjects on insulin together with one of the diabetes medications listed above are eligible for inclusion. This approach may select against type 2 diabetic subjects with more significant degrees of pancreatic beta cell failure.<p>  **Challenges**    1. Potential case contamination with T1DM (Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus) and Mature Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) patients.    2. Potential control contamination with cases. However, an ICD9 code for T2D is likely for diet controlled patients. Also, the family history exclusion was added to reduce likelihood that patients were too young to have developed the disease yet.    3. Restrictions imposed by inclusion criteria for cases. One difficult area is the problems presented by patients on insulin alone with an ICD9 code for type 2 diabetes, as some of these patients could represent individuals with type 1 diabetes which has been misclassified as type 2 diabetes because of age of onset, etc. To address this, we have identified as cases, patients who are on insulin alone, AND: have been on a type 2 diabetes medication in the past, or do not have a type 1 DM diagnosis, but have at least two visits (on different dates) with the type 2 DM diagnosis in the problem list or in the encounter diagnosis.    4.

phs000385.v1.p1::: Epigenetic Profiling of Human Colorectal Cancer:::Study Description   DNA methylation, together with chromatin modifications, constitute the epigenome that functions to regulate gene expression and genome integrity. DNA methylation alterations are ubiquitous in human cancers, as many genes acquire DNA methylation in a cancer-specific manner. DNA methylation at these sites in the genome of cancer cells not only serves as a marker for tumor identification, but together with gene mutation and gene expression data, can also be used to describe subsets of tumors of the same organ source. We have previously shown distinct human colorectal cancer subtypes based on DNA methylation differences. Correlating these DNA methylation differences with clinical co-variates will serve to further understand how these distinct subtypes are generated. We have collected 100 colorectal tumor tissues (for which clinical information is known) and have obtained (unprotected) genome- wide DNA methylation and chromatin modification information for each sample for the purposes of identifying and classifying unique tumor subtypes of colorectal cancers. In addition, we have determined mutations of key genes relevant to colorectal cancer as well as gene expression profiles. We will use the clinical data for each de-identified sample to correlate with the DNA methylation, mutation and gene expression information so as to understand the driving forces behind these distinct colorectal subtypes.  We have selected the most promising tumors for whole-genome bisulfite sequencing using next-generation sequencing technology to obtain complete maps of colon cancer methylomes. Researchers will be unable to identify the subjects because the samples and associated information have been de- identified and anonymized by the tissue source site. In addition, upon receipt by the USC Epigenome Center, we have assigned new random identifiers for each sample. The data generated using these new codes are not traceable to the patient identity.    * Study Weblink: [USC Epigenome Center][1]    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 100  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://epigenome.usc.edu  :::Case Set::: 100:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000103.v1.p1::: Genome-Wide Association Studies of Prematurity and Its Complications:::Study Description   ** Important Links and Information **    * [Instructions][1] to request Authorized Access    * [Data Use Certification Agreement][2]    * [Apply for Authorized Access ][3]  Preterm labor resulting in the delivery of a premature child is a complex problem with an enormous impact on individuals, families and society. An estimated 500,000 children are born prematurely in the U.S. each year, and 5 million worldwide die annually of prematurity and its complications. Prematurity is also the single largest contributor to disability-adjusted life years, a measure of the lifetime impact of a disease. Despite the importance of the problem and its disproportionate occurrence in poor and minority populations, its underlying etiology (or etiologies) remains unknown; the single best predictor for preterm delivery is a previous preterm birth. The largest single cause of prematurity is spontaneous preterm labor, and suspected triggers for this include infection, stress, poor nutrition and genetic factors. Family and twin studies provide strong evidence that genetic factors underlie about 40% of the risk for prematurity. A major challenge in studying genetic factors in prematurity is maternal/uterine factors, fetal/placental factors, or both may influence risk. Thus, any approach to studying preterm birth should account for both infant and maternal risk, environmental covariates and interactions. The Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) is a well-established, prospective cohort that enrolled women early in pregnancy, prior to any adverse pregnancy outcomes, to minimize bias in data collection and sampling. See details at: [http://www.ssi.dk/English][4].  The DNBC followed over 100,000 pregnancies beginning in the first trimester and has extensive biological material and epidemiologic data on health outcomes in both mother and child. The current study posted on dbGaP contains data from a genome-wide case/control study using approximately 1,000 preterm mother-child pairs from the DNBC most with spontaneous onset of labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), along with 1,000 control pairs where the child was born at ~40 weeks' gestation. After data cleaning some small changes in case/control status and other variables resulted in minor changes in numbers of cases or controls in certain categories. Environmental variables are being used as covariates in the analysis.  To replicate positive findings, we are using additional mother-child pairs from the DNBC and from the general Danish population, as well as 2200 samples coming primarily from an African-American population known to have high rates of preterm labor and delivery. This group includes over 1000 mostly very low birthweight infants, over 500 infant term controls, 326 term mother/baby pairs and 180 preterm mother/baby pairs. The data from these additional cohorts will be available in separate dbGaP postings. The study is expected to yield a better understanding of the biology of parturition, identify common genetic factors that play a role in preterm birth and its complications and suggest environmental modifications that can prolong gestation, with the goal of improving both neonatal and adult outcomes.  This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [http://www.genevastudy.org][5]) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to prematurity and its complications through large-scale genome-wide association studies of a well-characterized cohort of Danish mothers and babies. Genotyping was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). Data cleaning and harmonization were done at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.    * Study Types: Nested Case-Control, Mother-Child Pairs    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 4136  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=NHGRI_DAC_Supplemental_Instruction.pdf     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000103.v1.p1     [3]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [4]: http://www.ssi.dk/English     [5]: http://www.genevastudy.org  :::Nested Case-Control, Mother-Child Pairs::: 4136:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000216.v1.p1::: International Consortium on the Genetics of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLEGEN):::Study Description   The genetic makeup of an individual strongly influences the risk of developing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The identification of genes that predispose an individual to SLE will lead to earlier and better diagnosis, better treatments, and possibly prevention.  To this end, the International Consortium on the Genetics of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLEGEN) was formed in 2005 and is composed of lupus researchers who agreed to pool their knowledge and resources to search for genes that predispose to lupus. Eight laboratories contributed DNA samples for genotyping at the Broad Institute and association with SLE was performed by the Data Coordinating Center (Wake Forest University), as part of a four stage study design. Stages one and two of this design were graciously funded by the **Alliance for Lupus Research** ([www.lupusresearch.org][1]). In this stage of the study, approximately 767 SLE patients (cases) were compared to approximately 383 non-SLE patients (controls) for differences among the Illumina HumanHap300. The affected individuals are all females of European decent. 82% of the cases are the index case from multiplex pedigrees for SLE and the remaining 18% have self-reported first degree relatives with SLE. A detailed summary of the methods and results can be found in the manuscript in Nature Genetics February 2008 by SLEGEN "_[Genome-wide association scan in women with systemic lupus erythematosus identifies susceptibility variants ITGAM, PXK, KIAA1542 and other loci][2]_".

phs000405.v1.p1::: Next Generation Mendelian Genetics: Malignant Hyperthermia:::Study Description   Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a genetic disorder that causes a profound metabolic derangement following exposure to certain anesthetics. While approximately half of all cases are associated with ryanodine receptor-1 gene (RYR1) mutations, many cases have an unknown genetic cause. We sought to identify rare variants in novel MH candidate genes by sequencing the protein- coding regions of the genomes of individuals whose disease was either ruled in or out by the gold-standard diagnostic test. We also carefully selected individuals from well-characterized families to use gene-sharing information and maximize efficiency in the study design. Exome sequencing has helped identify the causes of over a dozen Mendelian disorders, has high power at low sample sizes, and is cost-efficient compared to whole-genome sequencing.    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 13  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set::: 13:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

In the test a sample is extracted from the vastus lateralis muscle on the side of the upper leg and contraction strength is measured following exposure to both halothane and caffeine in the laboratory. The muscle contracture is measured that is attributed to exposure to halothane, caffeine or both. Once a diagnosis of MH susceptibility was made, the known causal genes (_RYR1_ and _CACNA1S_) were sequenced using cDNA derived from the muscle samples. Certain subjects who lacked a mutation in a known gene were selected for exome sequencing and high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping by the Leeds and University of Washington teams. These samples were de-identified and transferred to Seattle, WA, USA, for sequencing and genotyping. Analysis of the first set of sequences is underway, as is recruitment of additional samples for sequencing.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Jerry Kim, MD.

The resources available include highly-characterized, contaminant- free cell cultures and high quality, well-characterized DNA samples derived from these cultures, both subjected to rigorous quality control. The Repository was established in 1972 at Coriell and contains more than 9,500 cell lines, primarily fibroblasts and transformed lymphoblasts. The Repository has a major emphasis on inherited diseases and chromosomally aberrant cell lines. In addition, it contains a large collection dedicated to understanding human variation that includes samples from populations around the world, the CEPH collection, the Polymorphism Discovery Resource, Human Variation and many apparently healthy controls.  The Human Variation collection provides cell lines and DNA samples from a variety of populations. The panels of African-Americans (HD100AA) and Caucasians (100CAU) used for this study are comprised of samples present in the Repository that were originally collected over the years from apparently healthy people to be used as "controls", for example, unaffected family members of persons with identified mono-genetic diseases. The samples for the Han people of Los Angeles (HD100CHI) and the Mexican American Community of Los Angeles (HD100MEX), however, were collected relatively recently from volunteers, identified as member of these communities, specifically for use in these panels.  The Coriell Genotyping and Microarray Center in conjunction with the NIGMS repository used the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 platform to genotype 400 samples from the NIGMS human variation panels. The populations genotyped included Americans of African, Caucasian, Mexican, and Han Chinese ancestry. The Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array detects approximately 940,000 SNPs and provides copy number information for more than 900,000 additional locations across the genome.    * Study Weblink: [NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository][2]    * Study Type: Population-Based Control Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 400  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.nigms.nih.gov/     [2]: http://ccr.coriell.org/Sections/Search/Panel_Detail.aspx?Ref=HD100AA&PgId=202  :::Population-Based Control Set::: 400:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

The current African American and Caucasian panels were created at that time from cell lines in the collection that were identified by ethnicities stated in the clinical information supplied by submitting geneticists. They are not samples specifically collected for ethnic panels. The ID numbers for the panel members can be linked to the original reference numbers in the Repository catalog. The African American and Caucasian panels were first shipped in 2000.  2003: Samples from Chinese Americans and from Mexican Americans were collected in structured efforts involving community consultations in Los Angeles, California to provide samples for the respective panels. The cell lines and panels were created and first distributed in 2003.  2008: Genotyping data from the Affymetrix GeneChip 6.0 for the four panels was made available though Coriell and the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository pending availability in dbGaP through an NIGMS DAC. More than 6,000 cell cultures and 100,000 DNA samples have been distributed from these four sets of samples to hundreds of investigators in the US and overseas since the inception of the collection.  :::Study Attribution     * ** NIGMS Repository Project Officers **      * Judith H.

TCGA is a joint effort of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), which are both part of the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  TCGA projects are organized by cancer type or subtype. Click [here][6] for a current list of cancer types selected for study in TCGA.  Data from TCGA (e.g., gene expression, copy number variation and clinical information), are available via the [TCGA Data Portal][2], EXCEPT for the genomic sequence data (.bam files), which are hosted at the [Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub)][1].  Data from TCGA projects are organized into two tiers: **Open Access and Controlled Access**.    * Open Access data tier contains data that cannot be attributed to an individual research participant. The Open Access data tier does not require user certification. Data in Open Access tier are available in the TCGA Data Portal.    * Controlled Access data tier contains individual-level genotype data that are unique to an individual. Access to data in the Controlled Access data tier requires user certification through [dbGaP Authorized Access][5].    * Controlled Access data types consist of the following:      * Individual germline variant data (SNP .cel files)      * Primary sequence data (.bam files), which are available at CGHub      * Clinical free text fields      * Exon Array files (for Glioblastoma and Ovarian projects only)  **NOTE: TCGA strives to release most data in the open access tier.

[1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000178  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   TCGA utilizes a strict set of criteria for inclusion into the study due to the rigorous and comprehensive nature of the work being performed. Tumor samples and matched source of germline DNA are curated and processed by the [Biospecimen Core Resource][1], a centralized site that reviews sample data and processes all samples to ensure consistent pathology assessment and generation of molecular analytes (DNA and RNA).  TCGA is focusing on primary untreated tumors that were snap frozen upon collection. All tumors must have a matched normal sample from the same patient. In many cases, the matched normal is a sample of the patient's blood.  Once at the BCR, all samples are subjected to a quality control protocol before they are accepted for full analysis into the TCGA pipeline. Each sample is reviewed by a pathologist to confirm the diagnosis and that the sample meets inclusion criteria. Specifically, TCGA requires that samples contain at least 60% tumor nuclei and have less than 20% necrotic tissue. Once the sample passes the pathology review, nucleic acids are isolated and genotyping is performed so that each tumor sample is properly associated with the correct normal tissue. An important goal in establishing this central resource is to ensure that molecular analytes (i.e. DNA and RNA) extracted from tissue samples are of consistent and high quality. Next, these analytes, undergo a molecular quality control process and then are distributed to TCGA [Cancer Genome Characterization Centers][2] and [Genome Sequencing Centers][3] for genomic analysis.  All samples in TCGA have been collected and utilized following strict [policies and guidelines][4] for the protection of human subjects, informed consent and IRB review of protocols.

phs000201.v1.p1::: Acquired Copy Number Alterations in Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Genomes:::Study Description   We performed genome-wide copy number analysis with paired normal and tumor DNA obtained from 86 adult patients with de novo AML using the Affymetrix Genome- Wide Human SNP array 6.0 containing 1.85 million features. Acquired copy number alterations (CNA) were confirmed using an independent, higher resolution, custom array comparative genomic hybridization platform.  A total of 201 somatic CNA were found in the 86 AML genomes (mean 2.34 CNA/genome), with FAB M6 and M7 AML genomes containing the most changes (10-29 CNA/genome). Twenty-four percent of AML patients with normal cytogenetics had CNA, while 40% of patients with an abnormal karyotype had additional CNA detected by SNP array, and several regions contained CNA in multiple AML genomes. The mRNA expression levels of 57 genes were significantly altered in 27 of 50 recurrent CNA regions <5 megabases in size. Array data are available online at [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/][1] as GEO accession #GSE10358. A total of 8 uniparental disomy (UPD) segments were identified in the 86 genomes and 6/8 UPD regions occurred in samples with a normal karyotype. Collectively, 40% of AML genomes contained alterations not found with cytogenetics, and 96% of these regions contained known or novel AML associated genes. 43/86 AML genomes had no CNA or UPD at this level of resolution. The number of CNA per genome was not associated with overall survival, independent of cytogenetic classification.  In this study of 86 adult AML genomes, subcytogenetic CNAs or UPD did not add prognostic information to standard cytogenetics. However, arrays identified many somatically mutated oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and also genes not previously implicated in AML that may be relevant for pathogenesis.  AML CNA segments from 86 adult AML patients are available through dbVar at [ft p://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/dbVar/data/Homo_sapiens/nstd11_Walter_et_al_2009] [2].    * Study Type: Tumor vs. Matched-Normal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 86  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/     [2]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/dbVar/data/Homo_sapiens/nstd11_Walter_e t_al_2009  :::Tumor vs. Matched-Normal::: 86:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

In an effort to detect novel genomic rearrangements that could be promoting leukemogenesis in this subset of patients, we sequenced ribosomal RNA-depleted transcriptomes isolated from 5 hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples. In addition to looking for novel genomic rearrangements, we also sought to identify transcripts that could be created as a result of a novel posttranscriptional process. Surprisingly, we identified transcripts created as the result of exon circularization. The results of our studies are present in the paper "Circular RNAs Are the Predominant Transcript Isoform from Hundreds of Human Genes in Diverse Cell Types" published in PLoS ONE (PMID: [22319583][1]).    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 5  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22319583  :::Case Set::: 5:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000614.v1.p1::: Genomic Analysis of Pediatric Low Grade Gliomas:::Study Description   Pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) are among the most common solid tumors in children but, apart from mutations or duplications in the BRAF kinase in specific subclasses, few genetic driver events are known. Diffuse PLGGs compose a set of uncommon subtypes that exhibit invasive growth and are therefore especially challenging clinically. These tumors are particularly poorly understood. We performed high-resolution copy-number analysis of 44 diffuse PLGGs to identify recurrent alterations. Diffuse PLGGs exhibited fewer such alterations than adult low-grade gliomas, but we identified several significantly recurrent events. The most significant event, 8q13.1 gains, was observed in 28% of diffuse astrocytoma WHO grade II (DA2) and resulted in partial duplication of the transcription factor MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. A similar recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint was identified in two angiocentric gliomas in the related gene MYB on 6q23.3. Whole genome sequencing of a MYBL1-rearranged diffuse astrocytoma grade II demonstrated MYBL1 tandem duplication and few other events. Two truncated MYBL1 transcripts identified in this tumor induced anchorage- independent growth when expressed in 3T3 cells and tumor formation in nude mice. Truncated transcripts were also expressed in two additional tumors with MYBL1 partial duplication. Our results define clinically relevant molecular subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in the biology of low-grade gliomas.

phs000450.v1.p1::: Whole Exome Sequencing of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma:::Study Description   We performed massively parallel whole exome sequencing of 55 primary tumor samples from patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and matched normal tissue. We identified recurrent mutations in genes that are well known to be functionally relevant in DLBCL, as well as in genes for which a functional role in DLBCL has not been previously suspected. Significantly mutated genes include MYD88, CARD11, EZH2, CREBBP, as well as MEF2B, MLL2, BTG1, GNA13, ACTB, P2RY8, PCLO and TNFRSF14. Analysis of somatic mutations in patients with DLBCL also revealed that BCL2 mutations commonly occur in patients with BCL2/IgH rearrangements as a result of somatic hypermutation normally occurring at the IgH locus. The BCL2 point mutations are primarily synonymous, likely caused by AID-mediated somatic hypermutation, and those non-synonymous mutations that are observed tend to be found outside of the functionally important BH domains of the protein, suggesting that strong negative selection against BCL2 loss-of-function mutations is at play. We further identified genes with mutations that are likely to be functionally relevant despite being mutated at a low rate. These genes include KRAS, BRAF and NOTCH1 as likely drivers of DLBCL pathogenesis in some patients. Our data provide an unbiased view of the landscape of mutations in DLBCL. These data may point towards new targets for the treatment of DLBCL.    * Study Types: Case Set, Tumor    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 49  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set, Tumor::: 49:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000143.v1.p1::: Starr County Health Studies&#39; Genetics of Diabetes Study:::Study Description   An initial observation in the 1970s that Starr County, Texas, had the highest diabetes-specific mortality of any of the 254 Texas counties led to the establishment of a field office in Rio Grande City, Texas (the county seat of Starr County) and the initiation of a series of studies to understand the epidemiology and genetics of type 2 diabetes, its complications and related conditions in this predominantly (97%) Mexican American population. The field office opened in February 1981 and has operated continuously since then. During this time, three systematic surveys of the population have been conducted as well as family and longitudinal studies. Culturally sensitive diabetes education programs have been developed and implemented and also a weight loss intervention. In total, more than 23,000 Mexican American individuals have been examined with more than 200,000 aliquots of biological specimens stored. Collectively, these studies are known as the Starr County Health Studies.  The present Genetics of Diabetes Study has the goal of identifying loci/alleles that underlie susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in this high risk population using genome wide markers and association testing. The study makes use of two primary resources that have been developed in order to identify 1,000 type 2 diabetes cases and 1,000 disease free controls. In the first instance we have identified a subset of unrelated cases from the total cases that we have identified. Where multiply affected sibships were available, the youngest onset case with detailed phenotyping (including assessment of diabetic retinopathy) was selected. Controls came from a recent survey to establish a representative sample of the Starr County population. Blocks were randomly selected, households on selected blocks enumerated and one individual randomly selected from each household for a detailed examination. The examination included an oral glucose tolerance test. Those included as controls are those with no prior diagnosis of diabetes and a negative oral glucose tolerance test.  This collection of cases and controls provides the opportunity to identify susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes and its complications, specifically diabetic retinopathy and albuminuria. The data set also allows the examination of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance. The samples are split between those born in the United States and those born in Mexico and this gives a natural contrast for examining genotype and environmental interactions. It is anticipated that the understanding that will come will lead to strategies for delaying and preventing the onset of diabetes and its complications.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1980  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 1980:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Classification of diabetes was based on National Diabetes Data Group recommendations from 1978. All such individuals also meet current recommendations. Individuals were drawn from several studies that we have conducted in Starr County, Texas. In many cases sibships were recruited. In the case where more than one sibling was eligible, we selected the youngest onset sibling only in order to construct a sample with as few biological relationships as possible.  Controls were chosen because they had no history of diabetes and were negative for diabetes on an oral glucose tolerance test using a 75 gm glucose load.  :::AFFY_6.0:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 ][1]    * [ Diabetic Retinopathy ][2]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68003924[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68003930[uid]  :::Study History   1981  Field office established in Rio Grande City  1983  First systematic survey of the population completed  > Examinations in 150 pedigrees completed<td>  1985  Second systematic survey begun including abdominal ultrasound  1985  Longitudinal follow-up of 360 individuals with diabetes begun to study retinopathy  1991  Establishment of diabetes affected sibling pair resource begun  1993  Starr County Health Studies Office became an American Diabetes Association GENNID field site  1994  Culturally sensitive diabetes education program developed and testing begun  1995  Starr County Health Studies Office became a field site for the NHLBI Family Blood Pressure Program GENOA network  1996  Completion of first genome wide linkage scan for type 2 diabetes  2000  Identification of _calpain 10_ as a diabetes susceptibility locus among Mexican Americans  2007  Completion of genome wide linkage scan for diabetic retinopathy  2007  Completion of genome wide association study using Affymetrix HumanMapping 100K set  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Craig L.

phs000094.v1.p1::: International Consortium to Identify Genes and Interactions Controlling Oral Clefts:::Study Description   Oral clefts represent the most common group of craniofacial birth defects in humans, and include cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) and cleft palate (CP). Oral clefts have a complex and heterogeneous etiology, with strong evidence for both genetic and environmental causal factors. Candidate gene studies and genome wide linkage studies have yielded compelling but inconsistent evidence that multiple genes control risk, and several studies have shown evidence for interaction between genes and environmental exposures, especially maternal smoking and nutrient intake. This consortium pulls together a very large collection of cases and their parents from multiple populations, and offers a unique opportunity to expand the search for genes controlling risk to the genome wide level.  The specific aims are:    1. To conduct a genome wide analysis on 2000+ case-parent trios ascertained through a case with isolated, non-syndromic CL/P or CP to test for linkage and disequilibrium. Initial analysis will consist of individual tests for gene effects while simultaneously testing for GxE interaction with common maternal exposures including vitamin supplementation, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption (which have all been implicated as environmental risk factors for oral clefts).    2. To use haplotypes in tests for GxE interaction incorporating population specific estimates. Since haplotype frequencies vary among populations, trios will be assigned haplotypes in a stratified estimation and then a pooled test statistic will be constructed.    3. To test for interaction between SNPs in different genes showing evidence of influencing risk in a test for GxG interaction.    4. To test for interaction between genes and maternal biomarkers using trios from Utah where measures of plasma folate, vitamin B-6, homocysteine and zinc in mothers are available.  This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [http://www.genevastudy.org][1]), which was developed through the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to oral clefts through large-scale genome-wide association studies of well-characterized cases and their parents from multiple populations. Genotyping was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). The study was supported by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR). Data cleaning and harmonization were done at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.    * Study Types: Case Set, Parent-Offspring Trios    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 7507  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.genevastudy.org  :::Case Set, Parent-Offspring Trios::: 7507:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Parents were interviewed regarding family history and maternal exposures during the peri-conceptual period (3 months prior to conception through the first trimester). Exposure to maternal smoking, alcohol consumption and multivitamin use were covered in all populations, and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke during pregnancy was available in some populations.  :::Human610_Quadv1_B:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Cleft Lips ][1]    * [ Cleft Palate ][2]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68002971[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68002972[uid]  :::Study History   This consortium was formed in 2006 in response to the Genes and Environment Imitative (GEI), a NIH wide initiative.

phs000422.v1.p1::: NHLBI GO-ESP: Lung Cohorts Exome Sequencing Project (Asthma): Genetic variants affecting susceptibility and severity:::Study Description   The NHLBI "Grand Opportunity" Exome Sequencing Project (GO-ESP), a signature project of the NHLBI Recovery Act investment, was designed to identify genetic variants in coding regions (exons) of the human genome (the "exome") that are associated with heart, lung and blood diseases. These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied. These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease, contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention and treatments to specific populations. This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects. GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers - BroadGO and SeattleGO.  The exome sequencing asthma project includes 200 African-Americans with asthma from the NHLBI multicenter Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP). SARP participants were recruited at the NHLBI SARP sites with an emphasis on recruiting severe asthmatics (Moore et al., Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 2010. PMID: [19892860][1]). Asthma status was based on both a physician's diagnosis and either bronchodilator reversibility or hyper-responsiveness to methacholine as well as less than 5 pack years of smoking. All subjects were carefully characterized using the standardized SARP protocol which included spirometry (medication withheld), maximum bronchodilator reversibility, hyper- responsiveness to methacholine (not performed in subjects with low baseline FEV1), skin-tests to common allergens, questionnaires on health care utilization and medication use and sputum, lung imaging and bronchoscopy in a subset. In addition GWAS data are available ([phs000355][2], Illumina platform).    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 191  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19892860     [2]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000355  :::Case Set::: 191:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000374.v1.p1::: Whole Genomic Sequencing of Nine Primary Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Tumor/Germline Pairs:::Study Description   This study was the first-known effort to complete the complete genome sequencing of primary colorectal adenocarcinomas and the matched germline genome. Nine colorectal adenocarcinomas selected on the basis of having chromosomal instability were subjected to 'shotgun' Illumina sequencing with 101-bp paired end reads to an approximate goal of 30x coverage of tumor and of normal. From these sequences, we used various computational techniques to identify somatic point mutations, insertion/deletions and structural rearrangements in these tumors. From these data, we identified new insights into the rates of background mutations in these cancers, new spectrums of structural alterations including the identification of a novel in-frame fusion gene.    * Study Types: Case Set, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal, Whole Genome Sequencing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 9  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal, Whole Genome Sequencing::: 9:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Summary level phenotypes for the NHLBI CARDIA Cohort study participants can be viewed at the top-level study page [phs000285][2] CARDIA Cohort. Individual level phenotype data and molecular data for all CARDIA Cohort top-level study and sub-study are available by requesting Authorized Access to the NHLBI CARDIA Cohort [phs000285][2] study.  **For the GENEVA CARDIA project, three genotype call sets were generated from a single set of array scans as a consequence of DNA sample quality problems. These call sets are designated "Birdsuite-1", "Birdsuite-2" and "Beaglecall". ("Beaglecall" used both Birdseed and BEAGLECALL calling algorithms.) An analysis-ready genotypic data set is provided in PLINK format for the "Beaglecall" set only, because it performs very well in QC analyses. Only raw CHP and ALLELE_SUMMARY files are provided for the two Birdsuite call sets because they have significant quality issues. Use of the Beaglecall set is highly recommended. Users of the other two call sets should proceed with caution. More details are given in the genotypic QC report.**  The CARDIA study, sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), is a prospective, multi-center investigation of the natural history and etiology of cardiovascular disease in African-Americans and Whites 18-30 years of age at the time of initial examination. The initial examination included 5,115 participants selectively recruited to represent proportionate racial, gender, age, and education groups from 4 communities: Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN; and Oakland, CA. Participants from the Birmingham, Chicago, and Minneapolis centers were recruited from the total community or from selected census tracts. Participants from the Oakland center were randomly recruited from the Kaiser-Permanente health plan membership. From the time of initiation of the study in 1985-1986, five follow-up examinations have been conducted at years 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20. The Year 25 examination is scheduled to begin in 2010.  This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [http://www.genevastudy.org][3]) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors associated with variation in longitudinal blood pressure profiles during the critical transition period from young adulthood to early middle-age; and to characterize their interactions with relevant environmental factors, such as body weight profiles. Genotyping was performed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, a GENEVA genotyping center.

phs000547.v1.p1::: A Genome-Wide Association Study in Breast Cancer Patients from the Prospectively Randomized SUCCESS Trial:::Study Description   The SUCCESS-A Study ([http://www.success-studie.de][1]) is a randomized Phase III study of response to treatment of early primary breast cancer with adjuvant therapy after surgical resection. The primary outcome is disease-free survival and secondary outcomes are overall survival and toxicity. The study design includes comparison of two pairs of treatment regimes performed in sequence. The first randomization contrasts treatment with and without Gemcitabine (3 cycles of Epirubicin-Fluorouracil- Cyclophosphamide(FEC)-chemotherapy, followed by 3 cycles of Docetaxel(D)-chemotherapy versus 3 cycles of Epirubicin-Fluorouracil- Cyclophosphamide(FEC), followed by 3 cycles of Gemcitabine- Docetaxel(DG)-chemotherapy). The second randomization contrasts treatment with Zoledronate for two versus five years. Patients were recruited from 2005 to 2007 and a total of 3754 patients were included from 250 study sites across Germany. Genome-wide SNP microarray data and phenotype outcomes for the first phase of the study (treatment with and without Gemcitabine) are included in the GARNET (Genomics and Randomized Trials Network) pharmacogenomic study in this dbGaP submission. (The Zoledronate treatments are still underway).  SUCCESS-A is a an open-label, multicenter, 2x2 factorial design, randomized controlled, Phase III study comparing the disease free survival after randomization in patients treated with 3 cycles of Epirubicin-Fluorouracil- Cyclophosphamide(FEC)-chemotherapy, followed by 3 cycles of Docetaxel(D)-chemotherapy versus 3 cycles of Epirubicin-Fluorouracil- Cyclophosphamide(FEC), followed by 3 cycles of Gemcitabine- Docetaxel(DG)-chemotherapy, and to compare the disease free survival after randomization in patients treated with 2 years of Zoledronate versus 5 years of Zoledronate in patients with early primary breast cancer. Patients were required to have histopathological proof of axillary lymph node metastases (pN1-3) or high risk node negative, defined as: pT>2 or histopathological grade 3, or age ,  35 or negative hormone receptor, but were not allowed to have evidence of distant disease. Patients were entered into the study no later than 6 weeks after complete resection of the primary tumor. No antineoplastic treatment other than surgical treatment, the defined cytotoxic and endocrine treatment, and radiotherapy was allowed prior to study entry and during the course of the study. After surgery, leading to complete resection of the invasive and intraductal components of the primary tumor, patients were randomized to one of the following two treatments for the first phase of the project (which is included in this GARNET pharmacogenomics study):  **AA**: 3 cycles of 5-Fluorouracil 500 mg/m i.v. body surface area and Epirubicin 100 mg/m i.v. and Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m i.v., (FEC100), each administered on day 1, repeated on day 22, subsequently followed by 3 cycles of Docetaxel 75 mg/m body surface area i.v. (D), and Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m i.v. (30 min infusion) (G), administered on day 1, followed by Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m i.v. (30 min infusion) on day 8, repeated on day22  **AB**: 3 cycles of 5-Fluorouracil 500 mg/m i.v. body surface area and Epirubicin 100 mg/m i.v. and Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m i.v., (FEC100), each administered on day 1, repeated on day 22, subsequently followed by 3 cycles of Docetaxel 100 mg/m body surface area i.v. (D), administered on day 1, repeated on day 22  A second randomization was made for assigning patients to one of the following two subsequent treatments for the second phase of the project (NOT included in the pharmacogenetic study in this dbGaP submission):  **BA**: Zoledronic acid 4 mg i.v., every 3 months for the duration of two years, subsequently followed by zoledronic acid 4 mg i.v., every 6 months for the duration of additional three years  **BB**: Zoledronic acid 4 mg i.v., every 3 months for the duration of two years  Patients with positive hormone receptor status (10% positively stained cells for estrogen and/or progesterone) of the primary tumor were recommended to receive Tamoxifen treatment 20 mg p.o. per day for 2 years, after the end of chemotherapy . Subsequent to chemotherapy, postmenopausal patients with positive hormone receptor status were recommended to be treated with Anastrozole (Arimidex) 1 mg p.o. for additional 3 years, premenopausal patients will continue Tamoxifen treatment for those additional 3 years. In addition to tamoxifen, all patients with positive hormone receptor status of the primary tumor and under the age of 40 or restart of menstrual bleeding within 6 months after the completion of cytostatic treatment or with premenopausal hormone levels as defined below were recommended to receive Goserelin (Zoladex) 3.6 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks over a period of 2 years following chemotherapy. Premenopausal endocrine status will be assumed, if the following serum levels are met: LH < 20 mIE/ml, FSH < 20 mIE/ml and E2 > 20 pg/ml. Endocrine therapy will start after the end of chemotherapy.  All patients with breast conserving therapy or more than 3 axillary lymph node metastases or in the following cases after mastectomy will receive adjuvant radiotherapy: T3/T4-carcinoma, T2-carcinoma > 3 cm, multicentric tumor growth, lymphangiosis carcinomatosa or vessel involvement, involvement of the pectoralis fascia or a safety margin < 5 mm. Radiotherapy was usually performed after the chemotherapy and parallel to the beginning of the zoledronic acid therapy.  Initially, DNA was extracted for performing SNP microarray assays using blood collected at baseline prior to the first randomization. However, the first set of SNP microarray results indicated a quality problem with approximately 50% of the DNA samples. A majority of the problematic samples were replaced with DNA extracted from redrawn blood. The remaining problematic samples were 'restored' using an Illumina FFPE Restoration procedure. A total of 3322 subjects (1638 from arm AA and 1684 from arm AB) were successfully genotyped. Among those, 1771 were from original blood samples, 1092 from redrawn blood samples and 459 from restored blood samples.  The SUCCESS-A study is part of the Genomics and Randomized Trials Network (GARNET, [http://www.garnetstudy.org][2]) funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to disease-free survival for breast cancer patients using different forms of chemotherapy through large-scale genome-wide association studies of treatment response in randomized clinical trials. The study was conducted at the University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany. Genotyping was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR).

phs000535.v1.p1::: Whole Genome and Exon Capture Sequencing of Bladder Cancers:::Study Description   One primary bladder cancer and paired peripheral blood sample were subjected to whole genome sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. This technology was utilized to investigate the genetic basis of a durable remission of metastatic bladder cancer in a patient treated with everolimus, a drug that inhibits the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway. Among the somatic mutations found was a loss-of-function mutation in TSC1 (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1), a regulator of mTOR pathway activation. Targeted sequencing using an exon capture and sequencing assay was performed on 13 tumors derived from patients on the same everolimus trial as the index patient and the sequencing data from these tumors is included. TSC1 mutation status was correlated with response to everolimus. The index patient responder tumor and peripheral blood DNA were also subjected to exon capture and sequencing.    * Study Type: Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 14  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Cohort::: 14:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000517.v1.p1::: GWAS in African Americans, Latinos and Japanese:::Study Description   The Multiethnic Cohort Study is a population-based prospective cohort study (n=215,251) that was initiated between 1993 and 1996 and includes subjects from various ethnic groups - African Americans and Latinos primarily from Californian (great Los Angeles area) and Native Hawaiians, Japanese-Americans, and European Americans primarily from Hawaii. State drivers' license files were the primary sources used to identify study subjects in Hawaii and California. Additionally, in Hawaii, state voter's registration files were used, and, in California, Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) files were used to identify additional African American study subjects. In the cohort, incident cancer cases are identified annually through cohort linkage to population-based cancer Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries in Hawaii and Los Angeles County as well as to the California State cancer registry. Information on estrogen receptor status is also obtained through these registries. Blood sample collection in the MEC began in 1994 and targeted incident breast cancer cases and a random sample of study participants to serve as controls for genetic analyses. Subjects are frequency matched on age at blood draw and ethnicity. The following number of breast cancer cases and controls were genome-wide scanned as part of this study: African Americans, 473 cases and 464 controls; Japanese: 885 cases and 822 controls; Latinos, 520 cases and 544 controls.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 3708  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 3708:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000265.v3.p1::: The Human Gut Microbiome and Recurrent Abdominal Pain in Children:::Study Description   This project explores the nature of the human intestinal microbiome in healthy children and children with recurrent abdominal pain. The overall goal is to obtain a robust knowledge-base of the intestinal microbiome in children without evidence of pain or gastrointestinal disease, children with functional abdominal pain, and children with abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits (irritable bowel syndrome). Multiple strategies have been deployed to navigate and understand the nature of the intestinal microbiome in childhood. These strategies include 454 pyrosequencing-based strategies to sequence 16S rRNA genes and understand the detailed composition of microbes in healthy and disease groups. Microarray-based hybridization with the PhyloChip and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) probes are being applied as complementary strategies to gain an understanding of the intestinal microbiome from various perspectives. Data collected and analyzed during the HMP UH2 and UH3 Demo project, from a set of healthy and IBS children may enable the identification of core microbiomes in children in addition to variable components that may distinguish healthy from diseased pediatric states. We are currently analyzing the dataset for the presence of disease-specific signatures in the human microbiome, and correlating these microbial signatures with pediatric health or IBS disease status. This study explores the nature of core and variable human microbiomes in pre-adolescent healthy children and children with recurrent abdominal pain.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 69  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 69:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000127.v2.p1::: A Genome-Wide Association Study of Sporadic ALS in an Irish Population (SIALS) and Sequencing and Analysis of an Irish Human Genome:::Study Description   Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of motor neurons. Epidemiological studies indicate that 2-5% of cases are familial, usually with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. For a portion of these, causative genes have been identified. The remaining 95% of ALS cases are described as sporadic, and believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.  This study utilized samples from Irish patients with sporadic ALS and Irish control individuals. The aim of the study was to identify susceptibility alleles for ALS in the Irish population. Genome-wide, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was undertaken using Illumina 550K version 3 chips. Genotyping data are available on 221 SALS patients and 211 controls.  Future work will aim to examine ALS genetic risk at individual sequence level. As an initial step, as of September 2010 we have made available the human genome sequence from a single anonymous male control individual from the SIALS collection.  Recent studies generating complete human sequences from Asian, African and European subgroupings have revealed population specific variation and illuminated disease susceptibility loci. The Irish population is of interest because of its location at the periphery of Europe and also the impact its emigrants have had on the genetics of populations in a number of other countries. We have identified sequence variants that may be specific to this population and have identified potentially novel disease associated variants. We describe a novel method for improving SNP calling accuracy at low genome coverage using haplotype information. Overall we demonstrate utility in generating whole genome sequences to test general principles and reveal specific instances of human biology. With increasing access to low cost sequencing we would predict that similar studies will emerge.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 432  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 432:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000580.v1.p1::: Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE): Causal Variants Across the Life Course (CALiCo): Strong Heart Study (SHS) and Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS):::Study Description   The SHS is a study of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors among American Indian men and women. Using standardized methodology, it was designed to estimate cardiovascular disease mortality and morbidity and the prevalence of known and suspected cardiovascular disease risk factors and to assess the significance of these risk factors in a longitudinal analysis. The study included 13 American Indian tribes and communities in three geographic areas: an area near Phoenix, Arizona, the southwestern area of Oklahoma, and western and central North and South Dakota. The SHS included three components: The first was a survey to determine cardiovascular disease mortality rates from 1984 to 1994 among tribal members aged 35-74 years of age residing in the 3 study areas (the community mortality study). The second was the clinical examination of 4,500 tribal members aged 45-74. The SHS has completed three clinical examinations of the original Cohort (Phase I: 1989-1991; Phase II: 1993-1995; Phase III: 1998- 1999, respectively). The third component is the morbidity and mortality (M&M) surveillance of these 4,500 participants. Yearly SHS surveillance has only 0.2% loss to follow-up. All deaths and all nonfatal CVD events are classified by standardized criteria, including details of stroke and HF.  The Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS) is a genetic epidemiological study designed to investigate the heritability of CVD and its risk factors and to localize genes that contribute to CVD risk in American Indians. SHFS participants include 3,838 family members that were >/=15 years old, and ascertained through sibships of the original SHS, from 94 extended (large, multigenerational) families. Exams have occurred in a pilot Phase III (1998-1999, 900 SHFS participants), in Phase IV (2001-2003), and Phase V (2006-2009). SHFS morbidity and mortality surveillance has occurred throughout the study phases, with 0.3% lost to follow-up.

Major problems such as small community size, relatively young age, cultural diversity, and the geographic dispersion of the American Indian population made it difficult to determine the prevalence and severity of cardiovascular disease among American Indians. The Strong Heart Study (SHS) was designed to respond to this recommendation. Supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) beginning in October 1, 1988, it is the largest epidemiologic study of American Indians ever undertaken. The study included 13 American Indian tribes and communities in three centers in the following geographic areas: an area near Phoenix, Arizona, the southwestern area of Oklahoma, and western and central North and South Dakota. Because of the SHS, we now know that Cardiovascular disease has become the leading cause of death in American Indians.  Due to the importance of genetics in the occurrence of CVD, the SHS expanded to include a genetic family study. The Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS) is a genetic-epidemiological study arising from its parent study, the Strong Heart Study (SHS). The SHFS began as a pilot feasibility study during SHS Phase III (1998-1999), where approximately 30 families (10 from each center) with more than 900 family members, were recruited. The SHFS was fully established as a genetic study in Phase IV with a goal of investigating the heritability of CVD and its risk factors and to localize genes that contribute to CVD risk.  Advantages of the SHS include the following: 1) It provides health and genetic data on an underserved ethnic group. 2) It is the largest, longest longitudinal study in the US of CVD and its risk factors in individuals with diabetes. 3) Data from cardiac, carotid, and popliteal ultrasound measures will substantially improve understanding of the mechanisms of vascular disease in diabetes and the genetics of CVD. 4) The epidemic of obesity and diabetes in this population group has impacted people at very young ages, permitting analysis of genetic and environmental effects on these conditions with limited confounding by age effects. SHS may lead to valuable therapeutic and prevention strategies for this and other populations in the US and the world, where the epidemics of obesity, diabetes, and CVD are increasing rapidly.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Gerardo Heiss.

phs000539.v1.p1::: Next Generation Mendelian Genetics: Congenital Hyperinsulinism:::Study Description   The NHGRI Next Generation Mendelian Genetics project uses exome resequencing to identify variants in unsolved Mendelian diseases.  Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CHI) is the most common cause of hypoglycemia in the newborn and it is due to mutations in 8 different genes (ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HADH, SLC16A1, HNF4A and UCP2). It is a heterogeneous disease with variable onset (birth to adulthood) and a persistent, intermittent, or transient course with possible later conversion to non-autoimmune diabetes. Although mutations in the two subunits of the KATP channel (ABCC8 and KCNJ11) account for 50% of the cases, the other half is still genetically unexplained. CHI can be inherited in a dominant or recessive and can also present as a 'de novo' mutation.  We became part of this study when we submitted 8 DNA samples for exome sequencing, from patients with CHI of Caucasian ancestry, which had no mutations identified in ABCC8 or KCNJ1, with the goal to identify new mutations in known genes or new mutations in new genes or genetic variants.    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 8  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set::: 8:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Congenital malformations of the kidney and urinary tract are present in 3 to 7 per 1,000 births, accounting for 16% of birth defects. These malformations account for 40-50% of pediatric and 7% of adult end-stage renal disease worldwide. Among these malformations, RHD represents a severe forms of disease with profound impact on long-term renal survival. We found that a significant fraction of RHD patients have a molecular diagnosis attributable to a genomic disorder, suggesting kidney malformations as a sentinel manifestation of pathogenic genomic imbalances.    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 192  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set::: 192:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000185.v1.p1::: Genetic Studies in the Hutterites:::Study Description   We conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) of disease-associated quantitative phenotypes in the Hutterites, a founder population of European descent. The Hutterites in our studies live on communal farms in South Dakota and are related to each other through multiple lines of descent in a 3,657-person, 13-generation pedigree with 64 founders. The small number of founding genomes reduces genetic heterogeneity whereas their communal lifestyle ensures that non-genetic factors are remarkably uniform between individuals. During our _Phase 1 studies_, between 1996 and 1997, we measured qualitative and quantitative phenotypes that are associated with common diseases in ~750 individuals living in 9 Hutterite colonies. These individuals were genotyped using the Affymetrix 500k array. The SNPs included in our GWAS had >90% call rates, minor allele frequencies >5%, Hardy-Weinberg p-values >0.001 (corrected for Hutterite population structure), and fewer than 5 Mendelian errors. During our Phase 2 studies, between 2006 and 2009, we phenotyped ~900 individuals living in 9 Hutterite colonies (7 overlapping with Phase 1 colonies). The Phase 2 individuals were genotyped with the Affymetrix 5.0 or 6.0 array. The SNPs included in the GWAS had >95% call rates, minor allele frequencies >5%, Hardy-Weinberg p-values >0.001 (corrected for Hutterite population structure), and fewer than 5 Mendelian errors. The combined Phase 1 and Phase 2 sample includes 1264 unique individuals; ~ 400 individuals participated in both Phase 1 and 2 studies.

phs000126.v1.p1::: CIDR: Genome Wide Association Study in Familial Parkinson Disease (PD):::Study Description   This proposal brings together the two largest NIH funded genetic studies focused on the identification of novel genes that influence the risk of PD. These two studies, PROGENI (PI: Tatiana Foroud; R01NS037167) and GenePD (PI: Richard Myers; R01NS036711) have been evaluating and recruiting families with two or more PD affected members for more than 8 years and represent the largest such cohorts world-wide. The combined sample has more than 1,000 PD families. Each study has used rigorous clinical criteria to assess their study participants.  Unlike previous genome wide association studies (GWAS) in PD, all the PD cases in this proposal have a positive family history of disease. In the vast majority of these families, the index PD case has at least one sibling with the disease. Thus, the sample is unique for having substantial evidence for a genetic contribution to disease. The control group for this study consists of samples previously collected and maintained by the NINDS Repository.  Genome-wide, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping services were provided by the [Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR)][1].  Data analyses will focus on the identification of SNPs associated with PD susceptibility and the age of onset of disease.    * Study Weblinks: [GenePD][2]; [PROGENI][3]    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1991  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.cidr.jhmi.edu/     [2]: http://www.bu.edu/genepd/     [3]: http://progeni.iu.edu/  :::Case-Control::: 1991:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000343.v3.p1::: The Genomics and Randomized Trials Network (GARNET) Vitamin Intervention Stroke Prevention (VISP) trial:::Study Description   The VISP trial (PI Jim Toole, M.D., Wake Forest University School of Medicine) was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial that enrolled patients aged 35 or older with Hcy levels above the 25th percentile at screening and a non-disabling cerebral infarction (NDCI) within 120 days of randomization [Toole, 2002]. The trial was designed to determine if daily intake of a multivitamin tablet with high dose folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 reduced recurrent cerebral infarction (primary endpoint), and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or mortality (secondary endpoints). Subjects were randomly assigned to receive daily doses of the high-dose formulation (n=1,827), containing 25mg pyridoxine (B6), 0.4mg cobalamin (B12), and 2.5mg folic acid; or the low-dose formulation (n=1,853), containing 200mcg pyridoxine, 6mcg cobalamin and 20mcg folic acid. Enrollment in VISP began in August 1997, and was completed in December 2001, with 3,680 participants enrolled.  Within the trial, 2,164 participants from 46 clinic sites provided DNA and agreed for it to be shared for use in a genetic subset study of VISP. This study is part of the Genomics and Randomized Trials Network (GARNET, [http://www.garnetstudy.org][1]) funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to stroke through large-scale genome-wide association studies of treatment response in randomized clinical trials. Genotyping was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). Data cleaning and harmonization were performed at the GARNET Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.  The data of the VISP trial have been released to dbGaP users in several segments:  Version 1 (phs000343.v1.p1), consisted of n=4 phenotype datasets, and all raw, cleaned and imputed genotype data.  Version 2 (phs000343.v2.p1) included n=14 additional phenotype datasets (plus pedigree, consent, and sample-mapping data), and increased the available data to a total of n=970 phenotype variables.  **Version 3** (phs000343.v3.p1), the current release, includes all n=36 phenotype datasets (plus pedigree, consent, and sample-mapping data), and increases the available data to a total of n=1918 phenotype variables.

phs000494.v1.p1::: Better Outcomes for Children: GWAS from Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) - eMERGE Phase II data - (dbGaP Deposit 1):::Study Description   This submission includes genotyping data from 6 separate cohorts (named A-E here), each is described in separate paragraphs below.  **Cohort A) Autism** is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1.5 million people in the United States, at an estimated lifetime cost of $4 million. It is part of Pervasive Developmental Disorder characterized by impairments in communication, language and reciprocal social interaction, and by unusual patterns of restricted and repetitive interests or behaviors. Autism, or autistic disorder, is the most severe form of the disease which has a wide range of symptom severity encompassed by the more inclusive term, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The prevalence of Autistic Disorder is currently estimated to be 4 per 1000, affecting 4 times more boys than girls. Susceptibility to autism is clearly attributable to genetic factors but the extensive clinical and genetic heterogeneity within the disorder have hindered efforts at genetic dissection. Identifying the genetic variants that contribute to this highly heritable disease is crucial to advancing research on autism. Reported concordance rates among monozygotic twins range from 60%  90% and heritability of autism has been estimated to be 90% or greater. Identifying genetic variants that contribute to this highly heritable disease is crucial to advancing research on autism.  **Cohort B)** The long-term objective of this research is to determine the molecular genetic basis of **Cardiovascular (CV) disease** in the young; this study seeks to identify gene mutations that cause "structural heart defects". Every year in the USA, 32,000 individuals are born with CV malformations; approximately 20% die during the first year of life. Another 30,000 young people develop a disturbance of cardiac rhythm or conduction. In addition, the life expectancy of another 40,000 young people is shortened by other forms of CV disease. It is becoming more apparent that in spite of the success in diagnosis and treatment, very little is known about the causes of CV disease in the young; understanding the causes will permit insight into the pathophysiologic basis of disease and allow definition of disease risk - two critical elements for disease prevention. Disease prevention and/or risk modification promises to be the new frontier in the management of CV disease in the young.  **Cohort C) Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EE)** is one of the manifestations of eosinophilic gastrointestinal inflammation which have profound effects on a patient's health and development. Results of epidemiologic studies performed through our center demonstrate that eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disease is not an uncommon entity. While the epidemiology of eosinophilic esophagitis has not been thoroughly studied until recently, there appears to be a significant increase in the diagnosis of EE in the last decade. Based on our research, this mainly reflects increased disease recognition, but there is also a bona-fide increase in disease incidence which coincides with the increasing incidence of asthma and allergic diseases in the industrialized world. In addition, many patients with intractable symptoms thought in the past to represent atypical GERD or other disorders are now being recognized as having EE. Diagnosis of EE requires endoscopy and biopsies to document the characteristic histologic findings of esophageal eosinophilia. In general, this study proposed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying eosinophil growth, survival, migration, and function, and to investigate and further characterize the pathophysiology of, clinical manifestations of, and spectrum of disease severity of eosinophilic esophagitis in humans.  **Cohort D) Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)** is a debilitating complex genetic disorder characterized by inflammation of the joints and other tissues and shares histopathological features with other autoimmune diseases. It is considered a complex genetic disorder. There are more than 50,000 children with JIA in the USA, approximately 1 per 1000 births, which is about the same incidence as juvenile diabetes. It is believed that genes in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a role in defining genetic risk, and it can be hypothesized that loci in other chromosomal regions are involved in conferring risk in JIA. These candidate chromosomal regions can be identified using genome wide association analyses. The long-term goal is a comprehensive understanding of the genetic basis of these disabling arthropathies for which the molecular basis is not presently understood. The results of recent GWAS for Caucasian JIA were recently published in Arthritis Rheum. 2012 Feb 21 (Published online, [PMID=22354554][1]).  **Cohort E) Childhood Absence Epilepsy (CAE)** is characterized by very frequent (several to many per day) absence seizures in an otherwise normal child with an EEG usually demonstrating 3 Hz bilateral, synchronous, symmetrical spikewaves pattern with normal background activity. CAE occurs in 10% to 15% of all children with epilepsy with an annual incidence of 6.3 to 8/100,000 in children <15 years of age. Females are more affected than males. Epilepsy onset is typically between the ages of 4 to 8 years with a peak incidence of 6 to 7 years. CAE does not start after age 13 years. The primary objective of this study is: To identify the optimal anticonvulsant (i.e. the antiepileptic drug (AED) with highest rate of seizure control and lowest incidence of treatment limiting toxicity) used for the initial treatment of children with Childhood Absence Epilepsy (CAE). The secondary objectives are: To determine the pharmacogenetic and other non-heritable factors underlying the interindividual variation in anticonvulsant response efficacy and toxicity. To define and contrast the effects of ethosuximide, lamotrigine, and valproic acid monotherapy on cognition (attention), behavior and quality of life in children with Childhood Absence Epilepsy.  **Cohort F) Cincinnati Controls**. These are local healthy children selected to be representative of the population of Cincinnati with respect to gender and ancestry.  **Cohort G) Cytogenetics** cases are ascertained by the clinical request to obtain cytogenetic analysis. The platform used included genotyping data which are then available for genome wide association analysis    * Study Type: Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 4562  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22354554  :::Cohort::: 4562:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

All submitted genotyping records are from patients with electronic medical records at CCHMC.  **Cohort A) Autism**. The cases for this cohort comprise a subgroup of autism defined by a history of developmental regression. To ensure as homogeneous a sample as possible, subjects were included if they met criteria for Autistic Disorder by clinical evaluation, and confirmed by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Children were excluded from the study if they had a diagnosis of a developmental disorder in addition to autism, such as Down syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis or Fragile X syndrome. Children with epilepsy or a history of seizures were not excluded.  **Cohort B) Cardiovascular (CV) disease**. Based on the initial interview, a determination of the likelihood of familial CV disease in the young was made, and subjects were divided into two groups  two or more family members with CV disease in the young (familial) or no additional family history of CV disease in the young (nonfamilial). Probands were identified through their pediatric cardiologists.  Inclusion  a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in the young without regard to sex, age, or race in the proband; family members of probands were invited to participate. There is no known ethnic/racial predilection for cardiovascular disease in the young.  Exclusion  known genetic diagnosis (e.g. trisomy 21, chromosome 22q11 deletion, and any other cytogenetic abnormality) or certain phenotypes (e.g. hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Marfan's syndrome, etc.).  **Cohort C) Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EE)**. Individuals were required to meet at least one criterion from the list below in order to be included in the original study. Background information was required to analyze the data thoroughly including medical history, slides, and pathology reports, as well as information from CCHMC medical records:    1. Patients undergoing diagnostic endoscopy, colonoscopy, venipuncture, and/or atopy testing at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.    2. Patients cared for in CCHMC clinics, for example, Allergy/Immunology and Gastroenterology.    3. Participants could be no younger than one year of age and no older than 65 years of age.    4.

J Rheumatol 2004;31(2):390-2) [PMID: 14760812][1]  Exclusion: The patient was excluded if they had any uncontrolled, clinically significant pre-existing systemic disease unrelated to the primary rheumatic disease, including hepatic, renal, neurological, endocrine, cardiac, gastrointestinal or hematologic conditions. The patient was also excluded if he or she has a history or current substance abuse or psychiatric problem that, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with the ability to give informed consent or comply with study requirements or physician instructions.  **Cohort E) Childhood Absence Epilepsy (CAE)**. The original study was a parallel, randomized, double blinded study, with partial crossover to open label at treatment failure only. Three AEDs, ethosuximide (ETX), lamotrigine (LTG), and valproic acid (VPA) were compared as initial monotherapy in children with Childhood Absence Epilepsy (CAE) who weighed at least 10 kg and were older than 2.5 years old and younger than 13 years old at study entry.    1.

These are local CCHMC cases that were contributed to a larger study. They have previously been evaluated to report significant evidence for linkage on 21q and 7q in a subset of relative pairs affected by autism (Molloy et al. Mol Psychiatry. 2005 Aug;10(8):741-6; [PMID: 15940295)][1].  **Cohort B) Cardiovascular (CV) disease**. CV disease in the young is genetically heterogeneous. For example, tetralogy of Fallot has been associated with deletion of chromosome 22q11, trisomy 21 and mutations in TBX5, Jagged1 and Nkx2.5. Recognition of the genetic basis of CV disease in the young can be improved by using genetic models incorporating variable expressivity (individuals with the same gene mutation have different phenotypes) and reduced penetrance (some genotype positive individuals appear to have no phenotype). Other active projects include positional cloning and candidate gene analysis in 5p15-linked familial Atrial Septal Defect (ASD), and use of linkage analysis, positional cloning and candidate gene evaluation to study congenital heart defects, cardiomyopathies and disturbances of cardiac rhythm and conduction (long QT syndrome, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrioventricular block). Additionally, there is ongoing characterization of genotype-phenotype relations of known genes whose mutations cause CV disease in the young (e.g. NKX2.5 and TBX5). These are cases of CV disease evaluated at CCHMC.  **Cohort C) Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EE)**. Although the etiology of EE is unknown, several lines of evidence support an allergic cause, including the high incidence of atopy in patients with EE, the improvement in patient symptoms on an allergen-free diet, and the common findings of mast cell degranulation and mediators in tissue and stool samples. Prior work done in this area has focused on learning more about the biology of the eosinophil in vitro. One molecule that appears to be important in regulating eosinophilia is IL-5. This cytokine regulates the selective growth and differentiation of eosinophil progenitor cells and the post-mitotic survival and activation of mature eosinophils. Another molecule is eotaxin and its related family members eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3, a set of eosinophil-specific chemokines. Previously, we have shown that EE appears to have a strong genetic component based on the frequent presence of a familial inheritance pattern and the high sibling risk ratio (#&126;80-fold). Based on screening a custom DNA array containing 738 SNPs, we have identified an association of EE with SNPs associated with the gene encoding thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a key cytokine known to regulate Th2 cell polarization. Notably, using an independent genome wide association study (GWAS) approach, we have preliminarily linked EE with the same promising genetic locus (chromosome 5q22 near the TSLP and WDR36 genes). Our central hypothesis is that EE has strong genetic components that can be elucidated by a candidate gene approach focused on genes involved in asthma and allergy and by a GWAS analysis. These are cases of EE evaluated clinically at CCHMC.  **Cohort D) Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)**. Prior studies have focused on both genes and gene expression in JIA with both subtype specific differences being demonstrated. The genome effect initially focused on the MHC (or HLA region). Several associations have been described and the field reviewed. Age sensitivity of these genetic effects is substantial. With the accumulation of multiplex as well as simplex JIA families we were able to study linkage between JIA and HLA and this has been demonstrated for both pauciarticular and polyarticular onset disease. While non-MHC genes to date have proven harder to find than HLA region genes, several candidate genes have been identified including a T-cell receptor null gene (V6.1) and, more recently, cytokine gene effects for IL6 and IL4 have been documented. All of the cases submitted were evaluated at CCHMC.  **Cohort E) Childhood Absence Epilepsy (CAE)**. Childhood Absence Epilepsy (CAE) is the most common childhood epilepsy syndrome. Although our recent clinical trial of 446 children with CAE found ethosuximide as optimal initial short term therapy, is it not clear how short term results relate to long term outcomes. Optimal long term therapy can be determined by following these children for four more years. In its first 6 years, the 32 center CAE trial successfully completed a double blind randomized controlled comparative trial comparing short term outcomes for ethosuximide, lamotrigine and valproic acid as initial therapy for children with newly diagnosed CAE characterized by only absence seizures. The CAE trial established ethosuximide as the optimal initial short term therapy for children with newly diagnosed CAE. All of the cases submitted were evaluated at CCHMC.  **Cohort F) Cincinnati Controls**. This was designed to be a sample of controls to use in genetic and other studies at CCHMC. All of the controls submitted have an electronic medical record at CCHMC.  **Cohort G) Cytogenetics**. Since 2008, the Cytogenetics Laboratory at CCHMC has used Illumina genotyping arrays containing 660,000 or 1.2 million markers for cytogenetic analysis. This cohort contains the genotyping data records and demographics from patients in which this analysis was performed as a component of their clinical care.

The GEOS study consists of 921 ischemic stroke cases with age of first stroke 16-50 years and a similar number of controls, identified from the Baltimore- Washington area. Cases and controls were recruited in 3 different time periods: Stroke Prevention in Young Women-1 (SPYW-1) conducted from 1992-1996, Stroke Prevention in Young Women-2 (SPYW-2) conducted from 2001-2003, and Stroke Prevention in Young Men (SPYM) conducted from 2003-2007. The overall GEOS sample includes 477 cases who self-reported their race as "white" and 396 cases who self-reported their race as "African American."  Traditional stroke risk factors and other study variables, including age, ethnicity, and history of hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction (MI), current smoking status, and current oral contraceptive use (both defined as use within one month prior to event for cases and at a comparable reference time for controls), were also collected during standardized interview and were included as covariates in our analyses.  This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [http://www.genevastudy.org][4]) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to early-onset ischemic stroke through large-scale genome-wide association studies of cases and controls of European and African descent from the Baltimore-Washington area. Genotyping was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). Data cleaning and harmonization were done at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1862  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=NHGRI_DAC_Supplemental_Instruction.pdf     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000292.v1.p1     [3]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [4]: http://www.genevastudy.org  :::Case-Control::: 1862:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000093.v2.p2::: A Genome Wide Scan of Lung Cancer and Smoking:::Study Description   The majority of cases of lung cancer are the culmination of a dynamic process that begins with smoking initiation, proceeds through dependency and smoking persistence, continues with lung cancer development and ends with progression to disseminated disease or response to therapy and survival. We are conducting a whole genome study of lung cancer and smoking to examine critical steps in lung cancer progression.  This study is a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to investigate the genetic determinants of lung cancer risk. The study design efficiently allows identification of genes that also contribute to smoking persistence and outcome from lung cancer using a single GWAS of 5,900 subjects using the primary GENEVA dataset, derived from two studies. The first is the **E**nvironment **a**nd **G**enetics in **L**ung Cancer **E**tiology Study (EAGLE), a population-based, biologically intensive, case-control study from the Lombardy region of Italy including ~2000 newly diagnosed lung cancer cases and ~2000 age-, gender- and region- matched controls. The second is the **P**rostate, **L**ung, **C**olon and **O**vary Study (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial from which we have selected ~850 lung cancer cases and ~850 controls, also matched on age and gender. Understanding the basis for the well- established hereditary component of lung cancer and smoking persistence could provide new insights into etiology, prevention, and treatment, and have an enormous impact on public health.  The same GWAS genotyping data in the two studies will be used to investigate the genetic determinants of smoking persistence. Specifically, we will analyze current smokers and former smokers from EAGLE and PLCO for diverse smoking phenotypes, including persistence of smoking as well as ever/never smoking comparisons, quitting attempts, and the Fagerstrom index of tobacco addiction.  PLCO participants are all European-Americans and EAGLE involves subjects from Italy.  > EAGLE is a case-control study and contains 3937 phenotyped subjects.<br> PLCO is a screening trial with a cohort design and contains 1651 phenotyped subjects.

The case group consisted of ~2,000 newly incident lung cancer cases, born in Italy, of Italian nationality, with official residence in one of 216 selected municipalities, male and female, 35 to 79 years old, collected before or after surgery and prior to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. All histologic types and stages of lung cancer are represented. Cases were consecutively collected in the departments of thoracic surgery, general surgery, general medicine, and oncology of the participating hospitals. Subjects in intensive care units, or with cardiac, hepatic, renal, or CNS failure, or with uncompensated schizophrenia, psychosis, or inability to speak were excluded. <p>  _Control ascertainment_  > The control group consisted of ~2,000 gender and age- and region- matched subjects selected through the Regional Health Services Database. Other exclusion criteria are the same as for the case group. All study participants provided written informed consent. <p>  **PLCO**  > PLCO is a randomized screening study with a cohort design. Patients are stratified by participating center, gender, and age (55-59 vs 60-64 vs 65-69 vs 70-74) and randomized to one of two treatment arms. In the Control arm, patients receive standard medical care. In the Screened arm, all patients undergo sigmoidoscopic examination and chest x-ray; men also undergo DRE (Digital rectal exam) and PSA (Prostate-specific antigen) testing and women undergo a transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125 (Cancer Antigen-125) test. A scheduling and tracking procedure is implemented to ensure regular attendance at repeat screens for subjects screened negative or for those who are designated suspicious or positive at screening but for whom subsequent diagnostic procedures do not reveal prostate, lung, colorectal, or ovarian cancer (follow-up diagnostic procedures are through their own medical care environment). Patients diagnosed via a screening test with cancer of the prostate, lung, colorectum, or ovary are referred for treatment in accordance with current accepted practice for appropriate stage of disease, patient age, and medical condition; DRE (men only), transvaginal ultrasound (women only), and chest x-ray are repeated annually for 3 years. Patients who have never smoked do not receive a third chest x-ray. A Periodic Survey of Health questionnaire is mailed to each participant annually for 13 years to identify all prevalent and incident cancers of the prostate, lung, colorectum, and ovary as well as all deaths that occur among both screened and control subjects during the trial. <p>  :::HumanHap550v3.0:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Lung Neoplasms ][1]    * [ Smoking ][2]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68008175[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68012907[uid]  :::Study History   **EAGLE**  EAGLE is a large population-based case-control study designed and conducted to investigate the genetic and environmental determinants of lung cancer and smoking persistence using an integrative approach that allows combined analysis of genetic, environmental, clinical, and behavioral data.  The study includes over 2,000 incident lung cancer cases, both males and females of Italian nationality, ages 35 to 79 years old, with verified lung cancer of any histological type, and over 2,000 healthy population-based controls matched to cases by age, gender, and residence. The participation rate was high: 85% and 73% in cases and controls, respectively.  Lung cancer cases were enrolled from 13 hospitals within the Lombardy region of Italy. The healthy controls were randomly selected from the same residential area of the lung cancer cases. The study setting, the Lombardy region of Italy, is served by a network of modern hospitals, medical schools, and a regional health service. Within the Lombardy region, the catchment's area includes 5 cities and 216 surrounding municipalities, encompassing, in the selected age range, over 1.3 million people.  Extensive epidemiological data have been collected through both an interview- based computer-assisted questionnaire and a self-administered questionnaire. Available data includes demographical characteristics, detailed smoking history (active and passive), family history of lung cancer and other cancers, previous lung diseases, medications, diet, alcohol, attempts at quitting smoking, anxiety, depression, personality scores, occupation, reproductive and residential history.  Clinical data (stage, grade, histology, imaging and pathology reports, spirometry, and routine laboratory studies) were recorded. All study subjects donated a blood sample (or, rarely, a buccal rinse sample), which was processed to obtain cryopreserved lymphocytes, RBC, granulocytes, DNA, RNA, whole blood, buffy coat, serum, plasma, and blood cards. Lung tissue paraffin blocks and slides were collected from the cases who underwent surgery, biopsy or cytological examination of the lung tumor. Multiple fresh "normal" lung tissue and tumor samples, frozen in liquid nitrogen within 20 minutes of excision, were also collected from over 500 surgical cases.  All data and biospecimen information are stored in a secure relational database. Quality control procedures were implemented to ensure accuracy, completeness, and privacy of the data collected. Genetic and epidemiological studies are ongoing. This study will help answer many questions related to lung cancer etiology in the near future.  **PLCO**  The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) is a multi-center clinical trial sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. The purpose of the PLCO Trial is to determine whether certain cancer screening tests reduce deaths from these cancers of the prostate, lung, colorectum, and ovaries. Together, these four cancers account for about 60% of all diagnosed cancers in the United States. Enrollment opened in 1993 and ended in 2001, with over 155,000 men and women participating at 10 locations throughout the United States. Blood specimens are collected from screened participants, buccal cell DNA from controls, and histology slides from cases; these are maintained in a biorepository. Participants complete a baseline questionnaire (covering health status and risk factors) and a dietary questionnaire. More than 12,000 participants were enrolled in the pilot phase (concluded in September 1994). Data were scanned into on-site computers for uploading by participant identification number to the coordinating center for quality checks, archival storage, and preparation of analysis datasets for use by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Scientific direction is provided by NCI scientists, trial investigators, external consultants, and there is an independent data safety and monitoring board. Performance and data quality are monitored via data edits, site visits, random record audits, and teleconferences.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigators **      * Neil Caporaso.

phs000383.v1.p1::: Genome-Wide Association Study of Breast Cancer in the African Diaspora - the ROOT study:::Study Description   The paucity of data on the genetic epidemiology of breast cancer for racial/ethnic groups other than those of European ancestry hinders the development of innovative interventions to reduce health disparities. Women in the African Diaspora experience a disproportionate burden of pre-menopausal breast cancer in comparison to all other races for reasons that remain unknown and understudied. This higher proportion of early-onset breast cancer might suggest a stronger genetic component in these populations. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed several genetic loci that confer risk of breast cancer. Because all GWAS started the discovery stage in women of European ancestry and replicated mainly in women of European ancestry, we propose a novel approach for a GWAS in indigenous African women to identify alleles associated with breast cancer risk which will then be replicated in other populations. This innovative design builds on our current understanding of the etiologic heterogeneity in breast cancer and the distribution of breast cancer molecular subtypes which differ between women of African ancestry and women of European ancestry. The major objective of the proposed studies is to get to the "root" causes of breast cancer by identifying breast cancer risk alleles in a pooled sample of women of African ancestry and to replicate our findings in other populations.  To achieve this objective, we conducted a case control study of breast cancer in women of African ancestry, including Africans living in Nigeria, African Americans and African Barbadians. We will genotype ~3800 individuals using the Illumina HumanOmni2.5-Quad platform. We will conduct both standard and novel genetic analyses of the data to map genes associated with breast cancer susceptibility, verify genotyping and carry out fine-mapping studies in genes or regions showing association with breast cancer risk, and replicate in other African American and non-African American populations. By pooling unique resources from studies throughout the African Diaspora, this study has the potential to identify risk alleles in several genes that contribute to increased breast cancer risk and may have implications for early detection, prognosis and treatment of breast cancer in ALL women. This should ultimately lead to improved outcomes for those who suffer a disproportionate burden of early-onset breast cancer.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 3766  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 3766:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

The inclusion criteria for the 1780 participants are: 1) a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder as confirmed by the CIDI psychiatric interview, 2) an age between 18 through 65 years, 3) sufficient knowledge of the Dutch language, and 4) North-european ancestry. As the samples should be representative of patients seen in different settings, there are few a priori exclusion criteria. Excluded patients are: 1) those with a primary diagnosis of psychosis, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, severe addiction disorder and 2) those with insufficient knowledge of the Dutch language.  **Control selection:**  For age and gender matched control subjects are mainly derived from the Netherlands Twin Register, for which data collection in twin, their parents, spouses and siblings occurred in 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997, 2000, 2002/3 and 2004/5. A total of 1860 controls were selected (only one member from each family) with the following inclusion criteria: 1) age 18 through 65 years, 2) never scoring high (> 0.65) on a general factor score for anxious depression (a combined measure of neuroticism, anxiety and depressive symptoms via questionnaires, Boomsma et al., 2000), 3) never reported a history of MDD in any survey, and 4) North-european ancestry.

phs000153.v6.p5::: FHS-Net Social Networks:::Study Description   **Note: Data Use Restrictions:**    * The data __must only__ be used for genetic research projects solely in the area of health-related social-network research.  This study compiles detailed information on family and social ties linked to participants in the offspring cohort of the Framingham Heart Study. The investigators took computerized information from self-report data used by the FHS for over 30 years to facilitate health exam scheduling. These tracking sheets asked participants to identify people close to them, which were assumed by the investigators to indicate a social tie. Individuals are listed as "egos" (if the ties are from their perspective) and/or "alters" (if they are linked as a friend or family members to one of the other participants). All egos were FHS offspring participants while alters could be FHS participants in any cohort or non-participants. This information was combined with internal FHS pedigree data on family ties to list family member alters (as well as the nature of their relationship). The resultant dataset therefore includes each ego-alter tie, the nature of their relationship and the start and end dates for their ties for each of seven waves for the offspring study.  Due to privacy concerns, all exam dates for individuals are listed relative to the initial FHS exam date. The study investigators chose a random, confidential date, to which all initial exam dates are linked (by number of months from random date to initial exam date). With this information, researchers can have access to the temporal relationships among participants' exam dates while remaining unaware of the actual exam dates for individual participants.  During each clinic exam cycle, the participants undergo a detailed examination including physical examination, medical history, laboratory testing, and electrocardiogram. Over the years, other tests (that may not be performed at every exam cycle) have included pulmonary function, lifestyle, physical function, cognitive function questionnaires, and various noninvasive cardiovascular tests including echocardiograms. This study involves phenotypic data from these exams including (when available) basic body measurements (height, weight, blood pressure), laboratory values (blood sugar levels, LDL levels), information on smoking and alcohol use, and tests of depression and cognitive functioning.  **Important links to apply for individual-level data**    1.

EGAS00001000054::: Identifying causative mutations for Thrombocytopenia with Absent Radii:::Study Description       Thrombocytopenia with Absent Radii is an inherited disorder that manifests itself with major limb skeletal abnormalities and low platelet count (and therefore a bleeding diathesis). The syndrome is well-characterised and defined phenotypically and there is a well-established database of UK-based families affected with ths disorder. The causative mutation for the disorder is yet to be identified. If known, it would allow for pre-natal screening and counselling avoiding life-long care for patients who are affected and are therefore severely disabled. We postulate that exon sequencing of 4 unrelated affected individuals would give enough power to narrow down potential candidate mutations which would thereafter be confirmed using DNA from other affected families.    * Study Weblink: [][1]    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access:  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]:  ::: :::0::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: 
phs000442.v1.p1::: Drug Resistant Hypertension in African Americans&#39; Exome:::Study Description   Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure that remains above goal in spite of the concurrent use of 3 antihypertensive agents of different classes or the concurrent use of 4 or more antihypertensive agents regardless of control. Its diagnosis is important for the identification of patients who are at high risk of having reversible causes of hypertension and/or patients who, because of persistently high blood pressure levels, may benefit from special diagnostic and therapeutic considerations. Resistant hypertension represents an extreme phenotype, thus, it has been predicted that genetic factors could play a larger role than for the general hypertensive population. Genetic assessments of patients with resistant hypertension have been limited. The current study assayed the exome of 91 African American patients with treatment resistant hypertension.    * Study Types: Longitudinal, Case Set, Exome Sequencing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 91  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Longitudinal, Case Set, Exome Sequencing::: 91:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000168.v1.p1::: National Institute on Aging - Late Onset Alzheimer&#39;s Disease Family Study: Genome-Wide Association Study for Susceptibility Loci:::Study Description   Alzheimer disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder of the elderly affecting an estimated five million Americans. Genetic factors contribute to the risk for disease with heritability estimates ranging from 57% to 79%. More than a decade ago, the 4 variant of APOE was identified and remains the most consistently replicated genetic variant influencing the risk of late onset Alzheimer disease. A segregation analysis suggests there may be four additional genes influencing the age-at-onset of Alzheimer disease. In 2007 there were 968 association studies in 398 candidate genes reported, but none replicated consistently. There are many reasons for the lack of consistency, but one important reason for the lack of progress is the paucity of a sufficient number of well characterized families and patients available to the entire scientific community. The extensive effort and expense required to ascertain such a population has been addressed by the NIA-LOAD Family Study. Its goal is to identify and recruit families with two or more siblings with the late-onset form of Alzheimer's disease and a cohort of unrelated, non- demented controls similar in age and ethnic background, and to make the samples, the clinical and genotyping data and preliminary analyses available to qualified investigators world-wide. Genotyping by the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) was performed using the Illumina Infinium II assay protocol with hybridization to Illumina Human 610Quadv1_B Beadchips. This genotyping represents the largest collection of families ever assembled with Alzheimer's disease combining the NIA-LOAD Genetics Initiative Multiplex Family Study, the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer's Disease (NCRAD) with additional controls from the University of Kentucky. These genotyping results will serve as a focal point for future research that will identify all of the remaining genetic variants in Alzheimer's disease.    * Study Weblinks: [The Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Initiative][1]; [The National Cell Repository for Alzheimer's Disease (NCRAD)][2]    * Study Types: Family, Longitudinal, Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 5220  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.niageneticsinitiative.org     [2]: http://www.ncrad.org  :::Family, Longitudinal, Case-Control::: 5220:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000254.v2.p1::: NHLBI GO-ESP Lung Cohorts Exome Sequencing Project: Genetic modifiers of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa)</i> lung infection acquisition in cystic fibrosis:::Study Description   The major goal of this project is to apply second generation resequencing technology to identify disease causing variants influencing pediatric and adult lung diseases in a collection of two longitudinal population cohorts of cystic fibrosis patients that have been well characterized for a comprehensive set of clinical traits. In Phase I, exome sequencing was performed on 43 cystic fibrosis patients with early _Pa_ infection and 48 cystic fibrosis patients with late _Pa_ infection to identify variants influencing the time to onset of _Pa_ infection. In Phase II, additional exomes were added to the study, to reach a total of 91 individuals with early _Pa_ infection and 96 with late _Pa_ infection. The majority of the 340 subjects of Phase II do not have a _Pa_ infection phenotype, but instead have a pulmonary function phenotype (121 severe vs. 124 mild impairment) as determined by the survival corrected Kulich FEV percentile of Corey et al.. A small minority have intermediate phenotypes and/or show severe decline in lung function during childhood.    * Study Weblink: [NHLBI GO ESP Project][1]    * Study Types: Cohort, Exome Sequencing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 431  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://esp.gs.washington.edu/drupal/  :::Cohort, Exome Sequencing::: 431:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Early _Pa_ acquisition is a major concern for CF care providers given that chronic infection with this pathogen is associated with significant CF morbidity and mortality. Two longitudinal population cohorts of cystic fibrosis patients that have been well characterized for a comprehensive set of clinical traits for the study of _Pa_ acquisition have contributed to this project. The first cohort, Early _Pseudomonas_ Infection Control (CFES-CF1), the world's largest, multicenter, longitudinal, prospective cohort of early lung disease in young CF patients consists of 1,704 CF cases who were ages  12 years old with no prior isolation of _Pa_ or at least a two-year history of _Pa_ negative cultures. The second cohort, the NHLBI-GWAS to identify CF modifiers (CFES- CF2), consists of 1,208 patients who are at the extremes of lung disease severity.  Exome resequencing of phenotypic extremes represents a cost-effective and robust strategy for the sensitive and specific identification of variants causing protein-coding changes influencing risk for complex traits.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigators **      * Michael Bamshad, MD.

phs000357.v1.p1::: Genome-Wide Association Study in Systemic Sclerosis:::Study Description   The Scleroderma Family Registry and DNA Repository (Registry) was initially developed as a registry and bio-specimen repository of patients with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), family members and unaffected normal controls. A case-control design was later adopted due to the lack of availability of many parents in this adult-onset disease, which precluded a linkage approach. In addition to collecting demographic data, the registry included the collection of disease-pertinent, cross-sectional, clinical information from medical records of affected participants. Registry participants were 18 years of age at enrollment. On the basis of medical record review, all cases were verified by the principal investigator to meet the eligibility criteria.  800+ blood samples from verified affected cases of European ancestry were selected for a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). These genetic data, as well as phenotypic data, are available in dbGaP. DNA, serum and plasma from Registry participants, which are currently being stored in the University of Texas Health Science Center - Houston, Scleroderma Registry Genetic Repository, are available for research purposes. However, not all of the 800+ registry participants who submitted a blood sample currently have DNA available due to depletion of some samples.  In addition to including the SNP data from the genome-wide scan on the 800+ samples, this dbGaP database provides a set of data tables with phenotypic information collected from the participants in the registry.    * Study Weblink: [Scleroderma Family Registry and DNA Repository][1]    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 833  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.uth.tmc.edu/scleroderma_reg/  :::Case-Control::: 833:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000102.v1.p1::: Ischemic Stroke Genetics Study (ISGS):::Study Description   The third leading cause of death in the United States, stroke is an acute neurological event leading to death of neural tissues. Although the majority of strokes are ischemic strokes, meaning there is oxygen deprivation to the brain, almost 20% of strokes are hemorrhagic, resulting from bleeding into the brain. Stroke is a complex disorder and likely multigenic in nature, resulting from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. These well characterized risk factors that contribute to the incidence of stroke include hypertension, cardiac disease, sickle cell disease, hyperhomocysteinemia, family history of stroke and smoking.  ISGS aim is to perform a prospective genetic association study of ischemic stroke focusing on the hemostatic system. ISGS is a 5-center case-control study of first-ever ischemic stroke cases and concurrent controls individually matched for age, sex and recruitment site.  This data includes that from subjects both banked in the [ NINDS repository][1] with biologicals publicly available, and those whose samples are not banked/not available.  This study utilized the [NINDS Repository Cerebrovascular/Stroke Study][2], and [neurologically normal controls][3] from the sample population which are banked in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS Repository) collection for a first stage whole genome analysis.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 485  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://ccr.coriell.org/Sections/Collections/NINDS/?SsId=10     [2]: ./study.cgi?id=phs000005     [3]: ./study.cgi?id=phs000004  :::Case-Control::: 485:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000472.v1.p1::: Estrogen Receptor Positive Breast Cancer: Aromatase Inhibitor Response Study:::Study Description   Highly variable outcomes are observed in patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer who undergo preoperative estrogen deprivation therapy with aromatase inhibitors (AI). In this study, 46 tumor and normal genomes and 31 exomes of participants selected from two clinical trials of neoadjuvant AI therapy on ER+ breast cancer were sequenced to identify somatic alterations that correlate with response to AI, to screen for therapeutic targets and to elucidate the genetic landscape of ER+ breast cancer. Of the significantly mutated genes, GATA3 mutations correlated with low post- treatment Ki67 and up-regulation of IGF1R mRNA. TP53 mutations associated with multiple markers of poor outcome and mutations in MAP3K1 associated with inferior clinical response. Mutations in MAP3K1 and MAP2K4 were mutually exclusive and positively associated with mutations in PIK3CA. The majority of tumors were multiclonal, as defined by distinct mutation clusters. A number of potential therapeutic targets were provided by both common and rare variants. Potential therapeutically relevant mutations of tryosine kinase included ERBB2, KIT, PDGFRA, DDR1, CSF1R, and MET.    * Study Weblink: [The Genome Institute at WashU: Genomics of Breast Cancer][1]    * Study Type: Tumor vs. Matched-Normal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 77  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://genome.wustl.edu/projects/cancer_genomics/genomics_of_breast_cancer  :::Tumor vs. Matched-Normal::: 77:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000125.v1.p1::: CIDR: Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism Case Control Study:::Study Description   This is a case-control study of alcoholism, in which the subjects have been drawn from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), a large, ongoing family-based study that includes subjects from seven sites around the US. COGA has gathered detailed, standardized data on study participants, including diagnostic and neurophysiological assessments. This sample has already proved successful in identifying several genes that influence the risk for alcoholism and neurophysiological endophenotypes, which have been independently replicated. COGA data were included as part of two Genetic Analysis Workshops, and the phenotypes are familiar to the genetics community.  Alcoholic probands were recruited from treatment facilities, assessed by personal interview, and after securing permission, other family members were also assessed. A set of comparison families was drawn from the same communities as the families recruited through an alcoholic proband. Assessment involved a detailed personal interview developed for this project, the Semi- Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA), which gathers detailed information on alcoholism related symptoms along with other drugs and psychiatric symptoms. Many participants also came to the laboratories for electroencephalographic studies. Neurophysiological features that have been shown to be useful endophenotypes for which we have linkage and in some cases association results are included on a subset of the case-control sample: the beta power of the resting electroencephalogram (EEG), the P3(00) amplitude of the visual event-related potential (ERP), and the theta and delta event- related oscillations (EROs) underlying the P3 (See Porjesz et al., 2005; Porjesz and Rangaswamy, 2007 for reviews).  A brief description of COGA is in Edenberg, H. J. (2002) The Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism: an update.

This case-control sample of biologically unrelated individuals was drawn from COGA subjects. All cases meet DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence. Controls are individuals who have consumed alcohol, but did not meet any definition of alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse, nor did they meet any DSM-IIIR or DSM-IV definition of abuse or dependence for other drugs (except nicotine). All cases and controls have undergone identical clinical assessments. Many individuals in this case-control sample have not previously been genotyped.

COGA includes nine different centers where data collection, analysis, and storage take place. The nine sites and Principal Investigators and Co- Investigators are: University of Connecticut (V. Hesselbrock); Indiana University (H.J. Edenberg, J. Nurnberger Jr., T. Foroud); University of Iowa (S. Kuperman); SUNY Downstate (B. Porjesz); Washington University in St. Louis (L. Bierut, A. Goate, J. Rice); University of California at San Diego (M. Schuckit); Howard University (R. Taylor); Rutgers University (J. Tischfield); Southwest Foundation (L. Almasy). Q. Max Guo serves as the NIAAA Staff Collaborator. This national collaborative study is supported by the NIH Grant U10AA008401 from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Funding support for genotyping, which was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research, was provided by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the NIH GEI (U01HG004438),and the NIH contract "High throughput genotyping for studying the genetic contributions to human disease" (HHSN268200782096C).

All subjects consented to sharing their samples. Both cases and controls were assessed by trained interviewers using the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism, a poly-diagnostic instrument.  Cases were alcohol dependent by DSM-IV criteria (at every interview if interviewed more than once). Probands were preferentially selected. Cases could not come from control pedigrees.  Controls were unaffected for a wide range of dependence phenotypes at every interview (if interviewed more than once). Controls could not have any alcoholism-related diagnosis (abuse or dependence or harmful use), nor could they have DSM-IIIR or DSM-IV diagnoses of cocaine abuse or dependence, marijuana abuse or dependence, opioid abuse or dependence, sedative abuse or dependence, or stimulant abuse or dependence. Similarly, controls could not have ICD10 diagnoses of cocaine dependence, marijuana dependence, opiate dependence, sedative dependence, or stimulant dependence. Controls could not share a known common ancestor with a proband. Controls above the age of 25 years were preferentially selected.  :::ILLUMINA_Human_1M:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Alcoholism ][1]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68000437[uid]  :::Study History   COGA was initiated in 1989, with Henri Begleiter as the Principal Investigator and Theodore Reich as the Co-Principal Investigator for 15 years. In 2004, while Henri Begleiter remained the PI, 4 Co-PIs were put into place: Howard Edenberg, Victor Hesselbrock, Bernice Porjesz and Laura Bierut. In 2006, the structure of the leadership changed again, with these 4 scientific Co-PIs leading the project, and Bernice Porjesz additionally serving as the Administrative PI. In addition to Henri Begleiter and Theodore Reich, several past key members of COGA were T.K. Li, Raymond Crowe, Wendy Reich and C. Michael Conneally, who have moved on to new positions or have retired.  In 1990, Phase I of COGA began, systematically ascertaining probands in treatment within six catchment areas, located across the United States (Indiana, New York, St. Louis, Connecticut, Iowa, San Diego). Probands met criteria of alcohol dependence based upon personal interview using the Semi- Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA), a polydiagnostic instrument developed by COGA, and had at least two first-degree relatives available for evaluation. Over the next 5 years, affected probands and family members participated in the study. During this time, Control families with the same family structure were also ascertained from the community, to be representative of the general population; controls did not have to be unaffected individuals. All families completed the same battery of tests. A subset of families underwent neurophysiological assessments.  In Phase II, between 1995 and 1999, some recruitment of new families continued, and the first follow-up protocol (5 year) was initiated. Affected families were extended. Adult clinical interviews conducted at this time used the SSAGA2 (a slight modification of the SSAGA to meet new diagnostic criteria).  Phase III began in 1999, and was primarily an extension of Phase II with an emphasis on recruiting high-risk families with young children. At this time Howard University became an additional recruitment site.  In 2004, COGA began Phase IV, the prospective study of adolescents and young adults from pedigrees ascertained in Phases I-III, which is ongoing. Participants are reassessed every two years.

phs000221.v1.p1::: NHLBI Family Heart Study (FamHS-Visit1 and FamHS-Visit2):::Study Description   The Family Heart Study (FamHS) was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). It was begun in 1992 with the ascertainment of 1,200 families, half randomly sampled, and half selected because of an excess of coronary heart disease (CHD) or risk factor abnormalities as compared with age- and sex-specific population rates (Higgins et al. 1996). The families, with approximately 6,000 individuals, were sampled on the basis of information on probands from four population-based parent studies: the Framingham Heart Study, the Utah Family Tree Study, and two Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) centers (Minneapolis, and Forsyth County, NC). A broad range of phenotypes were assessed at a clinic examination in broad domains of CHD, atherosclerosis, cardiac and vascular function, inflammation and hemostasis, lipids and lipoproteins, blood pressure, diabetes and insulin resistance, pulmonary function, and anthropometry (FamHS Visit 1). Approximately 8 years later, study participants belonging to the largest pedigrees were invited for a second clinical exam (FamHS Visit 2). A total of 2,756 Caucasian subjects in 508 extended families were examined.  A two-phase design was adopted for the genome wide association (GWA) study. In phase-1, 1007 subjects were chosen, equally distributed between the upper and lower quartile of age- and sex-adjusted values for coronary artery calcification, assessed by CT scan in Visit 2. These subjects were chosen to be largely unrelated; 34% of the subjects were from unique families, while 200 other subjects had 1 or more siblings selected into the sample, yielding a sample of 465 unrelated subjects. The remaining family members (N=1749) were genotyped in the phase-2 for replication of the top hits from the phase-1. The results presented here represent those for the analysis of the phase-1 case- control sample for variables assessed in FamHS Visit 1 (from 1992 to 1995) and for the variables assessed in FamHS Visit 2 (from 2002 to 2003).  All subjects were typed on the Illumina HumMap 550 chip (Phase 1 genotype). Of these, 33 (3.3%) were excluded due to technical errors, call rates below 98%, and discrepancies between reported sex and sex-diagnostic markers. The final sample of 974 subjects have Visit 2 phenotypes, approximately 100 of these do not have Visit 1 phenotypes. There was no significant plate-to-plate variation in allele frequencies.  The covariate adjustments were performed separately by sex using cubic polynomial age and clinical centers, and retaining the terms in the stepwise regression analysis that were significant at the 5% level. Extreme outliers (>4 SD from the mean) were set aside, temporarily, for the adjustments. The final phenotypes were computed for all individuals using the best mean regression models and standardizing to 0 mean and unit variance.  The FamHS has contributed GWA results in many phenotype domains (antropometric and adiposity, atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease, lipid profile, diabetes and glicemic traits, metabolic syndrome etc) to meta-analyses and various consortia, including Heard-Costa et al. 2009, Kottgen et al. 2010, Teslovich et al. 2010, Nettleton et al. 2010, Lango et al. 2010, Heid et al. 2010, Speliotes et al. 2010, Dupuis et al. 2010, Kraja et al. 2011.    * Study Weblinks: [The NHLBI Family Heart Study][1]; [FHS SCAN][2]    * Study Types: Family, Longitudinal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 0  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://dsgweb.wustl.edu/fhscc/     [2]: https://dsgweb.wustl.edu/scan/  :::Family, Longitudinal::: 0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

The high risk families were based upon the Framingham Family Risk Score, which in turn was based upon the number of family members with validated Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Events defined as any of Myocardial Infarction, Bypass Operation, or Balloon Angioplasty.  Families with two or more CHD events and risk scores of 0.5 or higher were considered to be eligible as a high risk family. Probands aged 45 or older and Family members aged 25 or older were offered clinic examinations provided that at least 50% of the eligible members, including at least two biologically related individuals returned personal medical histories. Random sample families were invited to clinic examinations using the same age and response criteria, but without regard to history of CHD.  (2) FamHS Visit 2:  Family members were included if they were members of Families who participated in Visit 1, above, and were at least 30 years old.  Participants were Excluded from Visit 2, if they were Pregnant, or unwilling to have a CT scan, or were below age 30 years or were heavier than the maximum weight for the local CT scanner. Women who had recently been pregnant needed to be 6 or more months postpartum by the time of their clinic exam and CT scan in order to be included.  :::HumanHap550v3.0:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Coronary Heart Diseases ][1]    * [ Atherosclerosis ][2]    * [ Cardiovascular Diseases ][3]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68003327[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68050197[uid]     [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68002318[uid]  ::: :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Michael Province, PhD.

It involves broad determination of the microbiota found in five anatomical sites: the oral cavity, skin, nasal cavity, gastrointestinal tract and vagina. This study will enroll approximately 300 healthy male and female adults, 18-40 years old, from two geographic regions of the US: Houston, TX and St. Louis, MO. The participation of healthy individuals will create a baseline for discovery of the core microbiota typically found in various areas of the human body. The information from this initial study can then be used to help assess the changes in the complement of microbiota found on or within diseased individuals.    * Study Type: Population-Based Control Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 300  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=NHGRI_DAC_Supplemental_Instruction.pdf     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000228.v3.p1     [3]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login  :::Population-Based Control Set::: 300:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000536.v1.p1::: Somatic L1 Retrotransposition in Colorectal Tumors:::Study Description   The purpose of this study is to ascertain the locations of somatic LINE-1 retrotransposition events in human colon tumor samples by pooling multiple tumor samples from different patients and performing a targeted resequencing assay (Ewing and Kazazian, Genome Research 2010) to sequence the 3flanking regions of all insertions in the pooled sample. The result is compared to the result of applying the same method to pooled normal samples from the same patients as were used in the pooled tumor sample and selecting sites that show an insertion in the tumor but not in the normaltissue and do not correspond to any known non-reference LINE-1 insertion allele. The selected sites are then validated by site-specific PCR and capillary sequencing to confirm that they represent LINE-1 insertions and to obtain breakpoint sequences.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 40  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 40:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Using Agilent exome hybridisation capture and Illumina GA massively parallel sequencing technology, we aim to sequence ~1600 microRNAs plus the protein coding genome of 25 matched human renal cancer samples. Bespoke algorithms are being developed to identify the somatically acquired point mutations, insertions and deletions in these samples. This project will give unprecedented insights into mutational processes, cellular repair pathways and gene networks associated with renal cancer development.Agilent whole exome hybridisation capture will be performed on genomic DNA derived from 25 renal cancers and matched normal DNA from the same patients. Three lanes of Illumina GA sequencing will be performed on the resulting 50 exome libraries and mapped to build 37 of the human reference genome to facilitate the identification of novel cancer genes.    * Study Weblink: [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000029][1]    * Study Type: Whole Genome Sequencing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access:  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000029  :::Whole Genome Sequencing:::0::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: 
EGAS00000000037::: Carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions in Europeans:::Study Description       An antiepileptic drug carbamazepine is well tolerated by the majority of patients, but can cause severe and potentialy fatal hypersensitivity reactions in a small number of individuals. The aim of this study was to identify genetic predictors of hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine. We undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 22 patients of European ancestry with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS) and compared our data with genotypes from a healthy population within the WTCCC. We performed imputation of classical HLA alleles according to a recently described method (Science. 2010 Dec 10;330(6010):1551-7. Epub 2010 Nov 4). GWAS statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression with an additive model of inheritance.    * Study Weblink: [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000037][1]    * Study Type: GWAS    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access:  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000037  :::GWAS:::0::: ::: :::ILLUMINA_Human_1M::: ::: :::

phs000276.v1.p1::: STAMPEED: Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966):::Study Description   The Northern Finland Birth Cohorts program (NFBC) was initiated in the 1960s in the two northernmost provinces of Finland to study risk factors involved in pre-term birth and intrauterine growth retardation, and the consequences of these early adverse events on subsequent morbidity and mortality. The uniqueness of NBFCs is that the data of the cohorts were obtained from early fetal life (including maternal health during pregnancy) to adulthood. The NFBC1966 includes 12,058 live births to mothers in the two northern-most provinces of Finland. Two decades later, a second cohort of 9432 births was obtained (NFBC1986). In NFBC1966 pregnancies were followed prospectively from the first antenatal contact (10-16th week). After birth, the offspring were examined and then again underwent clinical evaluation at ages 1y, 7y, 14-16y and 31y. At each visit, a wide range of phenotypic, lifestyle and demographic data were gathered by questionnaires and clinical examinations. For the most part, NFBC1986 has undergone similar evaluations to NFBC1966. Linkage to national registries includes hospitalization, deaths, education, medication, pensions, and provides up-to-date demographic and clinical information for members of both cohorts. DNA samples were obtained from 5,923 subjects from NFBC1966 and 6688 subjects from NFBC1986. Data coverage, 96% of all births in 1966 and 99% in 1986, is highly representative for the whole population. The NFBC program comprises more than 20 different projects coordinated by the Center of Lifecourse Disease studies in Northern Finland (COLD) at Oulu University. The prospective data collected from the NFBCs form a unique resource, allowing the study of disease emergence, and of the importance of genetic, biological, social and behavioral risk factors.  The genome-wide association (GWA) study sponsored through the STAMPEED program of NHLBI employed genomic DNA samples previously collected by the NFBC1966 study and stored in the DNA repository of the National Institute for Health and Welfare, Finland. This NHLBI sponsored RO1 project aimed to identify genetic variants contributing to metabolic and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In addition to de-identified genome wide genotypic data, a selected list of phenotypic data related to CVD including weight, height, BMI, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, insulin and fasting status, are also available in dbGaP. A summary of the GWAS for the NFBC1966 cardiovascular risk traits can be found in Sabatti et al., Nature Genetics 41: 35-46, 2009, PMID: [19060910][1].    * Study Weblink: [NFBC][2]    * Study Type: Longitudinal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 5402  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19060910     [2]: http://kelo.oulu.fi/NFBC/  :::Longitudinal::: 5402:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Genome-wide association analysis of metabolic traits in a birth cohort from a founder population. Nat Genet. 2009 Jan;41(1):35-46, PMID: [19060910][1].  Specific exclusion criteria used in the above analyses include:  > Subjects were excluded from analysis of specific phenotypes on the basis of criteria that were established separately for each phenotype. Individuals were excluded from analysis of lipid phenotypes (TG, HDL, LDL) if the blood sample was not collected after fasting, or if they were diabetic. Individuals were excluded from analysis of GLU and INS if the blood sample was non-fasting, if they were diabetic, on diabetic medication, pregnant, or if their glucoseinsulin measurement (after correction for sex, oral contraceptive use, and pregnancy status) was in excess of three standard deviations from the mean. Individuals were excluded from analysis of BMI if their weight was self- reported, or if they were pregnant. No exclusion criteria were applied to CRP or to SBP/DBP.  Any individual with genotyping call rates <95% was excluded from analysis. Subjects who were discrepant between their reported sex and the sex determined from the X Chromosome were excluded from analysis. We employed the identity- by-descent (IBD) analysis option of PLINK (Purcell et al. 2007, PMID: [17701901][2]) to determine possible relatedness among our sample subjects, and to identify sample duplications and sample contamination (the latter identified as subjects who appeared to be related to nearly everyone in the sample). If the sample duplication issue could not be resolved by external means, both samples were excluded. All apparently contaminated samples were excluded. Individuals related at the level of half-sibs or closer were identified with the IBD analysis and one subject excluded from each pair (the subject with less complete genotyping). Subsequent to this overall exclusion, subjects may be excluded from analysis of specific phenotypes as detailed above.

Data on the individuals born into this cohort (with expected date of birth in 1966) was collected since the 24th gestational week as well as their mothers and, to a lesser extent, fathers (NFBC1966). NFBC 1966 comprises of 12068 deliveries and 12231 children.  In 1985 the collection of a younger cohort (with expected date of birth in July 1985-June 1986) began in the same region with the special purpose of preventing mental and physical handicap (NFBC1986). NFBC1986 comprises of 9362 mothers and 9479 children.  For both cohorts interviews and postal questionnaires were completed/returned from the 24th gestational week onwards (data since 12-16th gestational week). The course of pregnancy and delivery, including complications, were confirmed from patient records, as was the neonatal outcome. The children were followed- up at the ages of 6-12 months, 7-8 years (NFBC 1986), 14-16 years (NFBC 1966, 1986) and at the age of 31 (NFBC 1966). Follow-up of the NFBC 1986 with clinical data collection -- similarly as for the NFBC 1966 at age 31-- was carried out during 2001-2003. The data have been supplemented by various hospital records and statistical register data.

phs000418.v1.p1::: Temporal Dissection of Tumorigenesis in Primary Cancers:::Study Description   The earliest genetic abnormalities in cancer represent a unique opportunity for timely clinical diagnosis. Classic deep sequencing of tumors identifies many aberrations acquired later in cancer progression. In this study, data regarding simple mutation and chromosomal aberration were integrated to trace the evolution of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and ovarian adenocarcinomas. Only after the second allele of TP53 was lost did the genome enter a window of extreme genomic vulnerability, in both cancer types, eventually acquiring more than 100,000 mutations in skin cancers. Inactivating Notch mutations were also identified as prevalent secondary changes. These results add context to the idea of TP53 mutation as dominant negative and occurring later in tumorigenesis.    * Study Type: Tumor vs. Matched-Normal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 8  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Tumor vs. Matched-Normal::: 8:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000138.v2.p1::: GWAS for Genetic Determinants of Bone Fragility in European-American Premenopausal Women:::Study Description   Osteoporotic fractures are largely due to an increased propensity to fall with aging and a reduction in bone strength. Although skeletal architecture contributes to fracture risk, bone mineral density (BMD) is the most important determinant of bone strength and fracture risk. Between 60 and 80% of the variance of BMD of adult Caucasian women is due to heritable factors. Final BMD is a function of peak bone mass attained during young adulthood and the subsequent rate of bone loss, which occurs as a result of both post-menopausal estrogen loss and aging. The evidence for a genetic contribution to rate of loss in BMD is substantially weaker than that for peak BMD. Therefore, we have focused our sample collection on the recruitment of premenopausal women, in whom we have sought to identify the genes influencing peak BMD at the spine and hip, the two major skeletal sites of osteoporotic fracture.  The primary goal of this study is to identify genes that affect peak BMD in premenopausal women. Identification of these genes may: 1) lead to molecular tests that predict risk of osteoporosis and allow institution of early preventive measures; 2) provide insight into basic bone cell biology and other factors that affect peak BMD; and 3) provide molecular targets for therapeutic agents to increase BMD.    * Study Type: Quantitative Cross-Sectional    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1493  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Quantitative Cross-Sectional::: 1493:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

The exclusion criteria were limited to irregular menses or a history of pregnancy or lactation within three months prior to enrollment, a history of chronic disease, current medications known to affect bone mass or metabolism, or inability to have BMD measured due to obesity.  :::Human610_Quadv1_B:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Osteoporosis ][1]    * [ Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal ][2]    * [ Bone Density ][3]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68010024[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68015663[uid]     [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68015519[uid]  :::Study History   Genetic studies of bone density at Indiana have been ongoing since 1988, beginning with studies in twin pairs.

phs000516.v1.p1::: Genome Sequencing of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma at The Human Genome Sequencing Center of Baylor College of Medicine (HGSC-BCM):::Study Description   Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) is the 11th most common cancer in the USA but the 4th in fatalities. The onset and progression of cancer is driven by extensive rearrangement and mutation of the genome. We combined our capability to capture and enrich exome DNA with the next generation sequencing capacity to allow us to detect and characterize the somatic mutation profile of 24 patients with PDAC. Patient samples were collected by the Elkins Pancreatic Center in the Baylor College of Medicine Department of Surgery. Sequencing of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the NHGRI Center Initiated Projects in progress in the Human Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor College of Medicine.

phs000462.v1.p1::: T2D-GENES Project 2: San Antonio Mexican American Family Studies:::Study Description   The Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) Genetic Exploration by Next-generation sequencing in Ethnic Samples (T2D-GENES) Consortium is a collaborative international effort to identify genes influencing susceptibility to T2D in multiple ethnic groups using next generation sequencing. T2D-GENES Project 2 is a complex pedigree- based study designed to identify low frequency or rare variants influencing susceptibility to T2D, using whole genome sequence (WGS) information from 1,043 individuals in 20 Mexican American T2D-enriched pedigrees from San Antonio, Texas. The major objectives of this study are to identify low frequency or rare variants in and around known common variant signals for T2D, as well as to find novel low frequency or rare variants influencing susceptibility to T2D.  The sampled individuals are obtained from two studies: the San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS) and the San Antonio Family Diabetes/Gallbladder Study (SAFDGS), collectively referred to as the San Antonio Mexican American Family Studies (SAMAFS). The strategy is to sequence approximately 600 individuals at an average of 50x coverage across the entire genome, then impute genome wide genotypes for about 440 additional family members. The 600 sequenced individuals are specifically chosen for their value in imputing sequence information into other family members. By studying large pedigrees, we expect to find multiple individuals carrying each genetic variant, even if this variant is very rare in the population at large. Thus, a pedigree-based approach provides an excellent opportunity for identifying rare novel variants influencing risk of T2D and quantitative variation in T2D-related phenotypes. The whole genome sequencing has been done commercially by Complete Genomics, Inc. (CGI).  The final data set includes whole genome sequence data for 607 individuals. After quality control, 585 sequenced individuals provide data for family based imputation, using Merlin linkage analysis software, into approximately 440 additional family members for whom chip based genotypes are available to indicate which parental haplotype is transmitted.  Extensive phenotype data is provided for 1048 individuals. These include 5 sequenced individuals who do not belong to any of the 20 large pedigrees. Phenotype information was collected between 1991 and 2011 in the two contributing longitudinal studies. SAFHS participants may have information from up to 5 visits, and SAFDGS participants may have up to 4 visits. The clinical variables reported are coordinated with T2D-GENES Project 1 (multi- ethnic exome sequencing) and include T2D status and age at diagnosis, glycemic traits (fasting and 2 hour glucose and insulin), blood pressure, blood lipids (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, calculated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides), clinical chemistry (cystatin c, glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody titer (GadAb), creatinine, adiponectin and leptin). Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was not measured for these individuals and insulin C-peptide is not included in this data set. Additional phenotype data include the medication status at each visit, classified in four categories as any current use of diabetes, hypertension or lipid-lowering medications, and, for females, current use of female hormones. Anthropometric measurements include age, sex, height, weight, hip circumference, waist circumference and derived ratios. Each phenotype variable has an initial summary column containing the most recent non-missing measurement for each individual, followed by the five potential time points for each individual, the number of non-missing measurements, and the age and year for the most recent non-missing measurement. For historical reasons, the order in which variables are presented on the dbGaP web site differs from their order in the data download file. When reading the comment fields for each variable, please note that commas are omitted to support data exchange in .csv format.    * Study Types: Family, Longitudinal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1048  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Family, Longitudinal::: 1048:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000462  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   The T2D-GENES Project 2 family data relate to two San Antonio-based family studies: SAFHS and SAFDGS. The SAFHS began in 1991, and included 1,431 individuals in 42 extended families at baseline. Probands were 40 to 60 year old low-income Mexican Americans selected at random without regard to presence or absence of disease, almost exclusively from Mexican American census tracts in San Antonio, Texas. All first, second, and third degree relatives of the proband and of the proband's spouse, aged 16 years or above, were eligible to participate in the study. As part of our ongoing studies, we are currently recruiting new family members from the original families. The SAFDGS also began in 1991, and originally included 579 examined individuals distributed across 32 pedigrees as part of the San Antonio Family Diabetes Study (SAFDS). The sample size was expanded to more than 900 individuals through two recalls. The second recall refers to the San Antonio Family Gallbladder Study (SAFGS), which recruited new family members from the original SAFDS families and family members from 8 newly recruited families. The SAFDS and SAFGS are collectively called the San Antonio Family Diabetes/Gallbladder Study (SAFDGS), which includes more than 900 subjects that are distributed across 40 extended families. The probands for the SAFDGS were individuals with T2D identified in an earlier epidemiologic survey, the San Antonio Heart Study. Only low-income Mexican Americans identified in the San Antonio Heart study as having T2D were eligible to be probands. These individuals were approached in random order without regard to how many T2D individuals were in their families (i.e., no attempt was made to preferentially recruit multiplex families). Thus, the T2D probands in the SAFDGS constitute a population based case series of T2D individuals. All first, second, and third degree relatives, aged 18 or above, were invited to participate in the study. As part of our ongoing studies, we have recalled some SAFDGS participants.  :::Assembler Version 1.11; File Format Version: 1.6;Human1M-Duov3_B;Human660W-Quad_v1_A;HumanExon510-Sv1 DNA Analysis BeadChip (HumanExon510Sv1_D);HumanHap550v3.0;ILLUMINA_Human_1M:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 ][1]    * [ Obesity ][2]    * [ Heart Diseases ][3]    * [ Kidney Diseases ][4]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68003924[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68009765[uid]     [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68006331[uid]     [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68007674[uid]  :::Study History   The T2D-GENES Consortium Project 2 data are obtained from 20 Mexican American T2D-enriched pedigrees chosen from the SAMAFS (i.e., SAFHS and SAFDGS). This project is part of one of the five awards funded by NIDDK under a cooperative agreement award mechanism, which is governed by the Steering Committee of the T2D-GENES Consortium. Of the available SAMAFS families, 20 large pedigrees, consisting 1,043 individuals, were selected for this project by focusing on large lineages in order to maximize the number of founder copies as well as to get an optimal ratio of sequencing efficiency and sufficient number of T2D individuals. These pedigrees average approximately 52 individuals with a maximum pedigree size of 87 individuals. The large pedigree-based approach is utilized to maximize the probability of identifying all genetic variants in the complete genetic regions of the genomes (i.e., whole genome) by sequencing, including rare variants that segregate within families. To perform WGS studies, the program "ExomePicks" was used, which suggested family members to be sequenced in large pedigrees. In total, approximately 600 individuals were chosen for WGS. The full sequences for the remaining of the 1,043 individuals are obtained using family-based imputation, given that individuals in the sample are previously assessed for a high-density SNP framework. The individuals have been followed in a mixed longitudinal fashion, up to a maximum of 5 visits. Phenotype data, including T2D affection status and T2D- related quantitative traits (e.g., glucose, insulin, BMI, blood pressure, and lipids), are available for the study participants. The genome-wide genotype data, representing more than one million SNPs, are available for the study participants. These data were obtained using different versions of the Illumina Infinium Beadchips: HumanHap550v3, supplemented with HumanExon510Sv1; Human660W-Quadv1; Human1Mv1; and Human1M-Duov3. The raw genotype data obtained were processed using standard quality control procedures.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Ravindranath Duggirala PhD.

phs000209.v11.p3::: Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Cohort:::Study Description   ** Important Links and Information **    * [Data Use Certification Agreement][1]    * [Apply for Authorized Access ][2]    * [Acknowledgement Statements][3]  **MESA**  > The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a study of the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease (disease detected non- invasively before it has produced clinical signs and symptoms) and the risk factors that predict progression to clinically overt cardiovascular disease or progression of the subclinical disease. MESA researchers study a diverse, population-based sample of 6,814 asymptomatic men and women aged 45-84. Thirty-eight percent of the recruited participants are white, 28 percent African-American, 22 percent Hispanic, and 12 percent Asian, predominantly of Chinese descent.<p>  Participants were recruited from six field centers across the United States: Wake Forest University, Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and University of California - Los Angeles. Each participant received an extensive physical exam to determine coronary calcification, ventricular mass and function, flow-mediated endothelial vasodilation, carotid intimal-medial wall thickness and presence of echogenic lucencies in the carotid artery, lower extremity vascular insufficiency, arterial wave forms, electrocardiographic (ECG) measures, standard coronary risk factors, sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors, and psychosocial factors. Selected repetition of subclinical disease measures and risk factors at follow-up visits allows study of the progression of disease. Blood samples have been assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for case-control studies. DNA has been extracted and lymphocytes cryopreserved (for possible immortalization) for study of candidate genes and possibly, genome-wide scanning, expression, and other genetic techniques. Participants are being followed for identification and characterization of cardiovascular disease events, including acute myocardial infarction and other forms of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and congestive heart failure; for cardiovascular disease interventions; and for mortality.  In addition to the six Field Centers, MESA involves a Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, and Central Reading Centers for Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Ultrasound, and Electrocardiography (ECG). Protocol development, staff training, and pilot testing were performed in the first 18 months of the study. The first examination took place over two years, from July 2000 - July 2002. It was followed by four examination periods that were 17-20 months in length. Participants have been contacted every 9 to 12 months throughout the study to assess clinical morbidity and mortality.  **MESA Family**  > The general goal of the MESA Family Study, an ancillary study to MESA funded by a grant from NHLBI, is to apply modern genetic analysis and genotyping methodologies to delineate the genetic determinants of early atherosclerosis. This is being accomplished by utilizing all the current organizational structures of the <b>Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)<b> and Genetic Centers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and University of Virginia.  In the MESA Family Study, the goal is to locate and identify genes contributing to the genetic risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), by looking at the early changes of atherosclerosis within families (mainly siblings). 2128 individuals from 594 families, yielding 3,026 sibpairs divided between African Americans and Hispanic-Americans, were recruited by utilizing the existing framework of MESA. MESA Family studied siblings of index subjects from the MESA study and from new sibpair families (with the same demographic characteristics) and is determining the extent of genetic contribution to the variation in coronary calcium (obtained via CT Scan) and carotid artery wall thickness (B-mode ultrasound) in the two largest non-majority U.S. populations. In a small proportion of subjects, parents of MESA index subjects participating in MESA Family were studied but only to have blood drawn for genotyping.  The MESA Family cohort was recruited from the six MESA Field Centers. MESA Family participants underwent the same examination as MESA participants during May 2004 - May 2007. DNA was extracted and lymphocytes immortalized for study of candidate genes, genome-wide linkage scanning, and analyzed for linkage with these subclinical cardiovascular traits. While linkage analysis is the primary approach being used, an additional aspect of the MESA Family Study takes advantage of the existing MESA study population for testing a variety of candidate genes for association with the same subclinical traits. Genotyping and data analysis will occur throughout the study.  **MESA Air**  > The general goal of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution (&#39;MESA Air&#39;) is to prospectively examine the relation between an individual level assessment of long-term ambient air pollution exposures (including PM<sub>2.5<sub> and the progression of subclinical cardiovascular disease in a multi-city, multi-ethnic cohort. MESA Air will also prospectively examine the relationship between an individual level assessment of long-term ambient air pollution exposures and the incidence of cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. MESA AIR is funded by a grant from the United States Environmental Protection Agency to the University of Washington and subcontracts from the UW to other participating institutions.  MESA Air will assess if ambient air pollution is associated with changes over time in subclinical measures of atherosclerosis and plasma markers of inflammation, oxidative damage, and endothelial activation in a longitudinal data model, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and specific cardiovascular risk factors (such as diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and diet). The study will similarly assess if the incidence of cardiovascular events is associated with long-term exposure to ambient air pollution, using a proportional hazards model. The study includes refinement of statistical tools, and explores joint/independent effects of acute and long-term pollutant exposure in the occurrence of cardiovascular disease.  The MESA Air study is built on the foundation of the ongoing MESA study. The parent MESA Study cohort is located in six geographic areas ('Field Centers') that capture tremendous exposure heterogeneity, comparable to or greater than the variability in locations of prior U.S. cohort studies. In addition to the six Field Centers, the study involves a Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, and Reading Centers for Computed Tomography (CT), ultrasound and air pollution data.  The cohort for the MESA Air study currently includes 6226 subjects: 5479 enrolled in the parent MESA study; 257 recruited specifically for this study, and 490 recruited from the MESA Family study. The entire MESA Air cohort will be followed over a 10-year project period for the occurrence of cardiovascular disease events.  On two occasions over the ten-year study period, 3600 subjects from the MESA Air cohort, residing in nine locales, will undergo computed tomography scanning to assess presence and extent of coronary artery calcification (CAC), and ultrasound of the carotid artery to determine intima-media thickness (IMT). We will also repeatedly assess plasma markers of inflammation, oxidative damage, and endothelial function in 720 subjects.  MESA Air adds state-of-the-art air pollution exposure assessment information to the MESA cohort study, and introduces new subjects and outcome measures to achieve our aims. The study will assess long-term individual-level exposure to ambient air pollutants for each subject using community-scale monitoring, outdoor spatial variation, subject proximity to pollution sources, pollutants' infiltration efficiency, and personal time-activity information. The exposure models will be validated using detailed monitoring in a subset of subjects.  **The MESA Cohort is utilized in the following dbGaP substudies.** To view genotypes, analysis, expression data, other molecular data, and derived variables collected in these substudies, please click on the following substudies below or in the "Substudies" box located on the right hand side of this top-level study page phs000209 MESA Cohort.    * [phs000420][4] MESA SHARe    * [phs000283][5] MESA CARe    * [phs000403][6] MESA ESP Heart-GO    * Study Weblinks: [MESA][7]; [MESA Air][8]    * Study Types: Longitudinal, Family    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 8296  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000209.v11.p3     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [3]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=MESAAcknowledgement.pdf     [4]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000420     [5]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000283     [6]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000403     [7]: http://www.mesa-nhlbi.org/     [8]: http://depts.washington.edu/mesaair/  :::Longitudinal, Family::: 8296:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Target raceethnic groups for each field center were chosen to maximize efficiency to detect race/ethnic differences and to allow the separation of the effect of race/ethnicity from that of study site.  MESA's primary hypotheses are concerned with the determinants and natural history of subclinical cardiovascular disease. Therefore, participants with known clinical disease were not recruited. Most other exclusion criteria related to the long-term nature of the study or to incompatibility with certain components of the MESA exam. Eligibility (or ineligibility) status was determined from self-reported information and no attempt was made to validate the participant's response. MESA's exclusion criteria are below:    * Age younger than 45 or older than 84 years    * Physician-diagnosed heart attack    * Physician-diagnosed angina or taking nitroglycerin    * Physician-diagnosed stroke or TIA    * Physician-diagnosed heart failure    * Current atrial fibrillation    * Having undergone procedures related to cardiovascular disease (CABG, angioplasty, valve replacement, pacemaker or defibrillator implantation, any surgery on the heart or arteries)    * Active treatment for cancer    * Pregnancy    * Any serious medical condition which would prevent long-term participation    * Weight >300 pounds    * Cognitive inability as judged by the interviewer    * Living in a nursing home or on the waiting list for a nursing home    * Plans to leave the community within five years    * Language barrier (speaks other than English, Spanish, Cantonese or Mandarin)    * Chest CT scan in the past year  **MESA Family**  > MESA Family participants are defined as siblings of index subjects from the MESA study.

phs000492.v1.p1::: Genetics of human developmental brain disorders:::Study Description   Developmental brain malformations are at the core of significant neurological diseases affecting many families in the United States and around the world. It is known that epilepsy, specific learning deficits and intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, and abnormalities of brain volume can be attributed in many cases to pathological malformations of the cerebral cortex. Although these consequences, such as epilepsy and intellectual disability, might appear broadly in the population as due to complex traits, this study's focus on those associated with cortical malformations highlights individual developmental pathways likely represented by innumerable and rare Mendelian alleles. Research has thus far uncovered dozens of genes responsible for these conditions and dissected the mechanisms underlying early cortical development in animals. However, this progress represents only the dawn of understanding the complex genetic network and neuronal architecture of the uniquely human cerebral cortex.  The overall goal of this study is to define the genetic bases of human cerebral cortical development. This is accomplished through (1) the ascertainment of families with disorders of human brain development and malformation, (2) categorizing these using medical, physical and neuroimaging data, and (3) mapping and identifying the gene causing the disorder of cortical development, which can then be investigated for its normal expression and function, and role in human disease.    * Study Types: Probands, Mendelian, Family    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 58  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Probands, Mendelian, Family::: 58:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

EGAS00000000074::: Evolution of an adenomacarcinoma in response to selection by targeted kinase inhibitors:::Study Description       Background - Adenocarcinomas of the tongue are rare and represent the minority (20-25%) of salivary gland tumors affecting the tongue. We investigated the utility of massively parallel sequencing to characterize an adenocarcinoma of the tongue, before and after treatment. Results - In the pre-treatment tumor we identified 7,629 genes within regions of copy number gain. 1,078 genes exhibited increased expression relative to the blood and unrelated tumors and four genes contained somatic protein-coding mutations. Our analysis suggested the tumor cells were driven by the RET oncogene. Genes whose protein products are targeted by the RET inhibitors sunitinib and sorafenib correlated with being amplified and or highly expressed. Consistent with our observations administration of sunitinib was associated with stable disease lasting 4 months, after which the lung lesions began to grow. Administration of sorafenib and sulindac provided disease stabilization for an additional 3 months after which the cancer progressed and new lesions appeared. A recurring metastasis possessed 7,288 genes within copy number amplicons, 385 genes exhibiting increased expression relative to other tumours and 9 new somatic protein coding mutations. The observed mutations and amplif ications were consistent with therapeutic resistance arising through activation of the MAPK and AKT pathways. Conclusions - We conclude that complete genomic characterization of a rare tumour has the potential to aid in clinical decision making and identifying therapeutic approaches where no established treatment protocols exist. These results also provide direct in- vivo genomic evidence for mutational evolution within a tumor under drug selection and potential mechanisms of drug resistance accrual.    * Study Weblink: [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000074][1]    * Study Type: Whole Genome Sequencing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access:  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000074  :::Whole Genome Sequencing:::0::: ::: ::: ::: ::: :::

phs000447.v1.p1::: Prostate Cancer Genome Sequencing Project:::Study Description   Prostate cancer is a prevalent cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in men. In order to characterize the full range of somatic mutations in protein-coding genes that may drive the growth of prostate cancer, we sequenced the exonic regions of genomic and tumor DNA from over 100 patients with high-risk primary prostate cancer. Using hybrid capture and paired end DNA sequencing, we identified mutations in several novel putative prostate cancer genes. We interrogated copy number changes across tumor genomes using high-density SNP arrays, and identified a molecular subtype of cancer characterized by mutation of the ubiquitin ligase subunit SPOP and copy number loss at specific genomic loci.    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 149  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set::: 149:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000247.v2.p2::: The Neonatal Microbiome and Necrotizing Enterocolitis:::Study Description   The Neonatal Microbiome and Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) study is a multi- centered case control study testing the hypothesis that NEC is a direct or indirect consequence of the enteric biomass, its products, or both. Very low birth weight infants (VLBW; birth weight  1500 grams) admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit are prospectively followed over the first 5 week or until they reach 36 weeks gestation, whichever occurs later. VLBW infants with a lethal clinical condition are excluded. Over the course of the study period, prospective samples are obtained on all infants, and include all stools, and weekly blood samples, palm and oral swabs. Clinical data is collected over the course of the entire hospitalization. Cases are identified based on Bell's staging for NEC, requiring Bell's stage II (abdominal clinical signs and radiographic evidence of pneumatosis, portal venous gas or pneumoperitoneum). Controls are identified from the pool of prospectively enrolled subjects, matching for gestational age, birth weight, post-natal age and birth date.  The microbial components of stool and its products before and at the onset of NEC, are then compared between cases and controls.  The Aims of this proposal are to (1) conduct a case cohort study in which we compare clinical data and biological specimens from cases and well-matched controls; (2) determine if the kind and density of intestinal biomass, its gene content, and transcriptional activity are associated with, and potential determinants of, NEC; and (3) determine if host risk alleles for intestinal inflammation play a role in the development of NEC.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 489  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 489:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000088.v1.p1::: Search for Susceptibility Genes for Diabetic Nephropathy in Type 1 Diabetes (GoKinD study participants and parents), NIDDK:::Study Description       Genetics of Kidneys in Diabetes (GoKinD) study is an initiative aimed at identifying susceptibility genes for diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes. A large number of individuals with type 1 diabetes were screened to identify two subsets, one with clear-cut kidney disease and another with normal renal status despite long-term diabetes. Those who met additional entry criteria and consented to participate were enrolled. When possible, both parents were also enrolled to form family trios. Altogether, GoKinD includes 3043 participants comprising 931 cases, 944 singletons, 268 pairs of parents of cases, and 316 pairs of parents of control. Accessible as a GAIN database are 905 of the cases, 890 of the controls, 10 pairs of parents of cases and 10 pairs of parents of controls (dbGaP [phs000018][1] _Search for Susceptibility Genes for Diabetic Nephropathy in Type 1 Diabetes (GoKinD study participants), GAIN_). The other parents and the remaining cases and controls are available by a separate application process through NIDDK. Interested investigators may request the DNA collection and corresponding clinical data for GoKinD participants using the instructions and application form available at [http://www.niddkrepository.org][2] or by contacting the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.    * Study Weblink: [GoKinD][2]    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1206  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./study.cgi?id=phs000018     [2]: http://www.niddkrepository.org  :::Case-Control::: 1206:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000298.v1.p1::: ARRA Autism Sequencing Collaboration:::Study Description   The root causes of autism remain unknown, limiting efforts to understand disease heterogeneity, diagnose cases, and prevent and treat disease. Epidemiological findings have repeatedly and unequivocally determined that heritable variation in DNA plays a substantial role in the etiology of autism and autism spectrum disorders, yet traditional efforts to identify the genetic basis of this striking heritability have met with very limited success to date and have therefore provided limited insight into disease biology. We propose here an unprecedented partnership between expert large-scale sequencing centers (at the Baylor College of Medicine and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard) and a collaborative network of research labs focused on the genetics of autism (brought together by the Autism Genome Project and the Autism Consortium). These groups will work together to utilize dramatic new advances in DNA sequencing technology to reveal the genetic architecture of autism, first through a comprehensive examination of the exonic sequence of all genes (that is, the coding part of the genome). The goal is to conclusively identify which genes harbor individual or collections of rare DNA variants that predispose to autism, and thus translate the abstract heritability into solid biological clues about disease pathogenesis that can be studied molecularly and approached therapeutically. These efforts and their follow-up, which will be performed on thousands of autism families collected by the autism research groups and being provided with phenotype data to NIMH repositories, will form the cornerstone of autism genetic research going forward.    * Study Weblink: [Autism_Wiki][1]    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 2441  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/autism/wiki/index.php/Main_Page  :::Case-Control::: 2441:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000346.v1.p1::: Genome-wide association study for Bladder Cancer Risk:::Study Description   This study funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) involves conducting a genome-wide association study of common genetic variants to identify markers of susceptibility to bladder cancer.  This bladder GWAS has led to the discovery of three novel regions in the genome associated with bladder cancer risk. Cases were defined as individuals having histologically confirmed primary carcinoma of the urinary bladder, including carcinoma in situ (ICD-0-2 topography codes C67.0-C67.9 or ICD9 codes 188.1-188.9). Scan data were obtained from two case-control studies carried out in Spain and the United States (specifically, those in the Maine and Vermont components of the New England Bladder Cancer Study) and three prospective cohort studies in Finland and the United States (specifically Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study, Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, and The American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort).  We used data from 591,637 single nucleotide polymorphisms 3,532 affected individuals (cases) and 5,119 controls of European descent and replication including 8382 cases and 48275 controls from 16 studies. In a combined analysis, we identified three new regions associated with bladder cancer on chromosomes 22q13.1, 19q12 and 2q37.1: rs1014971, (P = 8 x 10-12) maps to a non-genic region of chromosome 22q13.1, rs8102137 (P = 2 x 10-11) on maps to CCNE1 and rs11892031 (P = 1 x 10-7) maps to the UGT1A cluster on 2q37.1. We confirmed four previously identified genome-wide associations on chromosomes 3q28, 4p16.3, 8q24.21 and 8q24.3 (Rothman N et al., Nature Genetics, 2010, PMID: [20972438][1]).    * Study Types: Case-Control, Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 8646  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20972438  :::Case-Control, Cohort::: 8646:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

There are well- known epidemiologic factors that are associated with increased risk for bladder cancer: smoking and occupational exposure to aromatic amines, important clues for environmental, medication use, and lifestyle risk factors, as well as fluid balance and urine pH. The portfolio of established risk factors should provide opportunities to evaluate risk factors stratified by genotype and genetic factors within distinct exposure subgroups. There is also good evidence for a genetic component, given that previous studies have demonstrated reproducible associations with NAT2 and GSTM1 genotypes. Further, gene-environment interactions have been shown for smoking and specific NAT2 genotypes. The modest familial association has not yet been adequately explained but supports the need to search for genetic markers associated with bladder cancer. Together these observations provide a strong case for investigation of multi-genic associations as well as gene-environment interactions. Excellent information on clinical outcomes including survival and tumor recurrence is available for exploration of the influence of genetic variants on these outcomes, which could have potentially important clinical implications. Results from a GWAS leading to the identification of genetic makers could provide major insights into novel regions that regulate new mechanisms underlying bladder cancer pathogenesis. Findings from the GWAS could also provide etiological clues leading to the identification of additional modifiable factors that increase bladder cancer risk, recurrence and survival. The potential is great for advancing the understanding of the genetic contribution to bladder cancer, which could establish the foundation for developing novel approaches towards prevention while decreasing the burden of bladder cancer.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigators **      * Nathaniel Rothman.

phs000340.v2.p1::: The genomic complexity of early T-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia:::Study Description   **CREST**  The accurate identification of structural variations using whole-genome DNA sequencing data generated by next-generation sequencing technology is extremely difficult. To address this challenge, we have developed CREST, an algorithm that uses sequencing reads with partial alignments to the reference human genome (so-called soft-clipped reads) to directly map the breakpoints of somatic structural variations. We applied CREST to paired tumor/normal whole genome sequencing data from five cases of T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). A total of 110 somatic structural variants were identified, >80% of which were validated by genomic PCR and Sanger sequencing. The validated structural variants included 31 inter-chromosomal translocations, 19 intra-chromosomal translocations, one inversion, 22 deletions and 16 insertions. A comparison of the results generated with CREST to those obtained using the traditional paired-end discordant mapping methods demonstrate CREST to have a much higher sensitivity and specificity. In addition, application of CREST to publicly available whole-genome sequencing data from the human melanoma cancer cell line COLO-829 demonstrated the identification of 50 novel structural variations not detected using the standard methods, 20 of which were selected for validation with a 90% success rate. These data demonstrate that direct mapping of soft-clipped reads offers an improved method for detecting structural variants at the nucleotide level of resolution.  **T-ALL**  Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ETP ALL) is an aggressive malignancy of unknown genetic basis. We performed whole-genome sequencing of 12 ETP ALL cases and assessed the frequency of the identified somatic mutations in 94 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cases. ETP ALL was characterized by activating mutations in genes regulating cytokine receptor and RAS signalling (67% of cases; _NRAS_, _KRAS_, _FLT3_, _IL7R_, _JAK3_, _JAK1_, _SH2B3_ and _BRAF_), inactivating lesions disrupting haematopoietic development (58%; _GATA3_, _ETV6_, _RUNX1_, _IKZF1_ and _EP300_) and histone-modifying genes (48%; _EZH2_, _EED_, _SUZ12_, _SETD2_ and _EP300_). We also identified new targets of recurrent mutation including _DNM2_, _ECT2L_ and _RELN_. The mutational spectrum is similar to myeloid tumours, and moreover, the global transcriptional profile of ETP ALL was similar to that of normal and myeloid leukaemia haematopoietic stem cells. These findings suggest that addition of myeloid-directed therapies might improve the poor outcome of ETP ALL.    * Study Types: Whole Genome Sequencing, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal, Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 106  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Whole Genome Sequencing, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal, Case Set::: 106:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000261.v1.p1::: The Microbial Ecology of Bacterial Vaginosis: A Fine Scale Resolution Metagenomic Analysis:::Study Description   Archived self-collected vaginal swabs were utilized from a pilot study of vaginal douching cessation (NIH/NIAID R03-AI061131). Thirty-nine non-pregnant, reproductive-age women who reported the use of vaginal douche products in the two months prior to screening were enrolled. Thirty-three of these successfully completed the 16-week longitudinal study. Participants self- collected vaginal swabs and smears twice weekly. We report sequences based on the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified from whole genomic DNA isolated from the swabs. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is defined by Gram's stain of vaginal fluid (Nugent's score 7).  The large body of information generated will facilitate understanding of vaginal microbial community dynamics, the etiology of BV, and drive the development of better diagnostic tools for BV. Furthermore, it is hoped that the information will enable a more personalized treatment of BV and ultimately, prevent adverse sequelae associated with BV.    * Study Types: Prospective, Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 34  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Prospective, Cohort::: 34:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000424.v3.p1::: Common Fund (CF) Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx):::Study Description   **Lay Description**  The aim of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project is to increase our understanding of how changes in our genes affect human health and disease with the ultimate goal of improving health care for future generations. It was launched in 2010 as a two-year pilot project supported by the Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health (NIH). GTEx will create a database that researchers can use to study how inherited changes in genes lead to common diseases.  GTEx researchers are studying genes in different tissues obtained from many different people. The GTEx project also includes a study to explore the effectiveness of the GTEx donor consent process - this study will help ensure that the consent process and other aspects of the project effectively address the concerns and expectations of participants in the study. GTEx is a pioneering project that uses state-of-the-art protocols for obtaining and storing a large range of organs and tissues and for testing them in the lab. Until now, no project has analyzed genetic variation and expression in as many tissues in such a large population as planned for GTEx.  **Scientific Description**  Understanding the role of variation in the human genome is crucial to elucidating genetic contributions to human health and disease. Despite the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) documenting strong statistical associations between genetic variation and human traits, the functional role for most of these variants is largely unexplained. Nearly 90% of these GWAS-implicated sites lie outside of protein-coding sequences, suggesting that these variants might regulate gene expression.  The goal of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project is to establish a resource database in which to study the relationship between genetic variation and gene expression in reference/non-diseased tissues. The ultimate resource would include up to 1,000 post-mortem donors with several dozen tissues from each, a resource large enough to study both _cis_- and _trans_- gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Some tissue will also be banked for additional molecular analyses.  GTEx was funded as a 2-year pilot project by the NIH Common Fund (CF), and will assess the feasibility of collecting high-quality RNA from multiple tissues from healthy donors. The project will collect and analyze RNA levels in 30 or more different human tissues from 160 postmortem donors and 5 tissues from a similar number of surgical controls. Each donor will be characterized for germline genetic variation through dense genotyping arrays.  By treating RNA expression levels as quantitative traits, eQTLs will be identified as sites containing genetic variation that correlate with changes in RNA expression. Such eQTLs have been associated with 4%-12% of expressed human genes, and with common complex human diseases, including obesity, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, Crohn's disease, and asthma. Additionally, few studies have examined the tissue specificity of eQTLs. The GTEx project will thus serve as a resource database and tissue bank for many future studies, especially for understanding the functional basis of inherited susceptibility to disease.  It is anticipated that GTEx data will be made available through dbGaP on a periodic basis as it is generated.    * Study Weblinks: [The NIH Common Fund - GTEx][1]; [NCBI GTEx eQTL Browser][2]; [NHGRI GTEx][3]; [Broad GTEx][4]    * Study Types: Tissue Expression, Reference Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 187  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://commonfund.nih.gov/GTEx/overview.aspx     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtex/test/GTEX2/gtex.cgi     [3]: http://www.genome.gov/gtex/     [4]: http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/gtex  :::Tissue Expression, Reference Set::: 187:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000349.v1.p1::: SNPs and Extent of Atherosclerosis (SEA) Study:::Study Description   The SEA study is a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with premature atherosclerosis in subjects included in the Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth (PDAY) repository - a unique NHLBI resource including data, DNA and arterial specimens from over 3000 multi-ethnic subjects 15-34 years of age who died of non-atherosclerotic causes (mostly trauma). All PDAY subjects had post-mortem quantitative assessment of raised atherosclerotic lesions in their aorta and coronary arteries - making this the largest and most carefully phenotyped cohort for premature atherosclerosis in the world. The goal of the current project was to use the quantitative measure of raised atherosclerotic lesions in the PDAY cohort as the target phenotype for a genome-wide association study and to use quantitative measures of subclinical atherosclerosis (coronary calcium and carotid IMT) in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) to confirm or refute candidate loci identified from the PDAY analysis. Identifying genetic factors that predispose individuals to premature atherosclerosis could lead to more effective screening and early treatment of high risk individuals and suggest novel molecular targets for treatment and prevention interventions.    * Study Weblink: [SEA][1]    * Study Type: Cross-Sectional    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1068  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.sea-nhlbi.org/default.aspx  :::Cross-Sectional::: 1068:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000349  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   _PDAY Population and Atherosclerosis Phenotype_: From 1987 to 1994 PDAY centers collected standardized autopsy specimens and selected risk factor data from black and white males and females, age 15-34 yrs, who died within 72 hours after injury. Using an unlinked anonymous coding system, the specimens and data were submitted to central pathology laboratories for detailed histopathologic analyses. The right coronary artery and left half of the aorta were stained with Sudan IV and the percent of intimal surface involved with raised atherosclerotic lesions in the distal and thoracic aorta and right coronary artery was independently estimated by three pathologists. This produced a pathologically specific and quantitatively precise description of atherosclerosis extent that was strongly correlated with blood lipids and other conventional risk factors in the PDAY cohort*. For the current project the percent surface involvement in the distal and thoracic aorta and right coronary artery was summed and then adjusted for age^2, race and gender to produce a total raised lesion score which was the primary phenotype for our genetic association analyses.  Cases were defined as the PDAY subjects at >90th% for total raised lesion score.  Controls were selected from among PDAY subjects with a total raised lesion score = 0 after matching to cases (2:1) on age, race and gender.  In Phase I of the SEA Study quantitative genotyping was used to estimate allele frequency for >2.4 million SNPs in each of eight pools of DNA (3 case and 5 control pools). Pools were balanced for age, gender and genetic ancestry based on analysis of 311 ancestry informative markers typed on every sample before pool formation. Phase II and III of the SEA study involved individual level genotyping of promising SNPs in the PDAY subjects and subsequent replication in the MESA cohort. Phase II and III data are not included in the dbGap data set.  *A more detailed description of the measurement of raised lesions in the PDAY cohort can be found in: Strong JP, Malcom GT, McMahan CA et al.

phs000331.v1.p1::: A Genome-Wide Association Study in Patients Experiencing Drug-Induced Long-QT Syndrome and/or Torsades de Pointes; A Collaboration Between the NIH Pharmacogenomics Research Network and the RIKEN Yokohama Institute Center for Genomic Medicine:::Study Description   The goal of this study was to identify genetic risk factors for drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval (diLQT) and the ventricular arrhythmia torsades de pointes (TdP). We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) focusing on subjects with a history of long QT and/or TdP after taking medication. Controls for this study were individuals with a history of cardiac arrhythmias who had begun treatment with potentially QT-prolonging antiarrhythmics. An additional control group of normal volunteers were given ibutilide, a drug with documented proarrhythmic properties. All study participants were recruited and treated/evaluated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.  This study was conducted by the Pharmacogenomics of Arrhythmia Therapy subgroup of the Pharmacogenetics Research Network, a nationwide collaboration of scientists studying the genetic contributions to drug response variability. Genotyping was performed by the RIKEN research institute in Japan using the Illumina 610 Quad Beadchip platform.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 831  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 831:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000552.v1.p1::: Genomic Characterization of Meningiomas:::Study Description   Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumor in the US. Although the tumor suppressor gene NF2 is disrupted in approximately half of meningiomas, the complete spectrum of genetic changes in meningiomas remains poorly understood, particularly in the large subset of tumors without NF2 alterations. Therefore we performed whole-genome sequencing from 11 Grade I meningioma tumor-normal pairs and whole-exome sequencing from an additional 6 tumor-normal pairs to identify somatic mutations, insertions-deletions, copy- number alterations and rearrangements. We validated our results by performing focused sequencing across 48 additional meningiomas.    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 65  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set::: 65:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000255.v1.p1::: Effect of Crohn&#39;s Disease Risk Alleles on Enteric Microbiota:::Study Description   This UH2/UH3 demonstration project entitled "Effects of Crohn's disease risk alleles on enteric microbiota" is focused on characterizing intestinal associated microbiota in patients with ileal Crohn's disease (ileal CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and control patients without inflammatory bowel diseases (non-IBD). We hypothesize that genetic factors that affect Paneth cell function, contribute to compositional changes in intestinal microbiota. These changes in microbiota may lead to reduction of protective commensal organisms and increased numbers of aggressive organisms that incite intestinal inflammation. This hypothesis is being tested by high throughput 16S rRNA sequence analysis of de-identified ileal and colonic tissues that have been archived at Washington University St. Louis, University of North Carolina, Mount Sinai Hospital and the Cleveland Clinic. Multivariate analysis of the metagenomic data will be conducted with genotyping metadata (highly reproducible CD risk alleles, including NOD2 and ATG16L1) and phenotyping metadata (e.g. age, gender, race, body mass index, medications and smoking.)  Shotgun sequencing will be performed on selected fecal specimens linked to ileal tissues to identify additional, or auxiliary, or synergistic pathogenic factors or other functional changes in the microbiome. Because members of this research team have observed that a chronic viral infection is required for the Paneth cell defect in Atg16l1 hypomorphic mice, a major focus of these studies will be towards identifying potential viral triggers for the defective Paneth cell phenotype in individuals harboring the ATG16L1 risk allele. Novel genetic probes for protective and aggressive organisms will be developed by mining bacterial genome and shotgun sequencing data. Genomic sequences will be produced for candidate protective and aggressive strains (e.g. adherent- invasive strains of E. coli) isolated from human intestinal tissues where there is limited existing genome information. Quantitative qPCR assays using the novel as well as established genetic probes will be conducted to test the hypothesis that an imbalance between protective and aggressive organisms is associated with genetic factors that affect Paneth cell function.  Our combined expertise in multiple disciplines across multiple institutions, our demonstrated ability to collect a large number of well-phenotyped samples with longitudinal clinical information that will be linked to host response and morphologic studies, and our consortium's capacity for high-throughput sequencing will be used to investigate how alterations in human microbiome relate to CD risk alleles and CD pathogenesis.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 228  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 228:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, in which intestinal anatomy is altered, dramatically ameliorates and/or eliminates Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in 50-80% of patients within hours to days following surgery, well before significant weight loss, in contrast to other types of bariatric surgeries, such as gastric banding, that attenuate insulin resistance as a result of substantial weight loss that occurs over months to years. The molecular mechanism by which RYGB exerts this clinical phenomenon occurs is not known. The goal of this project was to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants associated with amelioration in T2D defined by medication independence. Identifying genetic variants that influence the dramatic resolution of T2D from RYGB may identify novel targets for pharmacological T2D therapies and/or identify patients in whom RYGB may not be effective.    * Study Weblink: [The eMERGE Network][4]    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 962  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000408.v1.p1     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [3]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=eMERGE_Acknowledgement.pdf     [4]: https://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/victr/dcc/projects/acc/index.php/Main_Page  :::Case Set::: 962:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000389.v1.p1::: GEnetics of Nephropathy - an International Effort (GENIE) GWAS of Diabetic Nephropathy in the UK GoKinD and All-Ireland Cohorts:::Study Description   Diabetic kidney disease, or diabetic nephropathy (DN), is one of the leading causes of end-stage renal disease in the United States and worldwide. DN is a common complication of long-standing type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The clinical course is characterized by development of proteinuria and gradual loss of kidney function. Although existing treatments that decrease proteinuria have been shown to moderately abate progression of diabetic kidney disease, many affected patients, who do not die from cardiovascular disease, go on to develop terminal renal failure, necessitating costly renal replacement therapies, such as dialysis and renal transplantation. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) can have its onset in childhood and affected individuals often develop end- stage renal disease in early adulthood, leading to further loss of quality of life. The genetic basis of the disease is not well understood.  The GENIE (**GE**netics of **N**ephropathy an **I**nternational **E**ffort) consortium was initiated to perform the most comprehensive and well powered DN susceptibility genome wide association study (GWAS) analysis to date, using the largest collection of type 1 diabetics with and without kidney disease across four study cohorts. The UK-ROI samples were genotyped as part of this project.  **UK-ROI Sample Description**  > The UK-ROI collection consists of samples derived from the Republic of Ireland (Dr. Catherine Godson, PI, at University College, Dublin, Ireland) and the United Kingdom (Warren 3 and Genetics of Kidneys in Diabetes UK, <b>UK GoKinD<b>, Dr. Alexander P. Maxwell, PI, at Queen's University of Belfast, UK). All study subjects met the inclusion criteria: white individuals with T1D, diagnosed before 31 years of age, whose parents and grandparents were born in the British Isles.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1801  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 1801:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000379.v1.p1::: Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA):::Study Description   **The Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA):** GENOA is one of four research networks that form the NHLBI Family Blood Pressure Program (FBPP). From its inception in 1995, GENOA's long-term objective was to elucidate the genetics of hypertension and its arteriosclerotic target-organ damage, including both atherosclerotic (macrovascular) and arteriolosclerotic (microvascular) complications involving the heart, brain, kidneys, and peripheral arteries. Two GENOA cohorts were originally ascertained (1995-2000) through sibships in which at least 2 siblings had essential hypertension diagnosed prior to age 60 years. All siblings in the sibship were invited to participate, both normotensive and hypertensive. These include non-Hispanic White Americans from Rochester, MN (n =1583 at the 1st exam) and African Americans from Jackson, MS (N=1854 at the 1st exam). During the second exam (2000-2005), approximately 80% of participants were re-recruited. The GENOA data consists of biological samples (DNA, serum, urine) as well as demographic, anthropometric, environmental, clinical, biochemical, physiological, and genetic data for understanding the genetic predictors of diseases of the heart, brain, kidney, and peripheral arteries.  **Family Blood Pressure Program (FBPP):** GENOA's parent program, the FBPP, is an unprecedented collaboration to identify genes influencing blood pressure (BP) levels, hypertension, and its target-organ damage. This program has conducted over 21,000 physical examinations, assembled a shared database of several hundred BP and hypertension-related phenotypic measurements, completed genome-wide linkage analyses for BP, hypertension, and hypertension associated risk factors and complications, and published over 130 manuscripts on program findings. The FBPP emerged from what was initially funded as four independent networks of investigators (HyperGEN, GenNet, SAPPHIRe and GENOA) competing to identify genetic determinants of hypertension in multiple ethnic groups. Realizing the greater likelihood of success through collaboration, the investigators began working together during the first funding cycle (1995-2000) and formalized this arrangement in the second cycle (2000-2005), creating a single confederation with program-wide and network-specific goals.    * Study Type: Sibling Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 0  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Sibling Cohort::: 0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000404.v1.p1::: The Genetic Architecture of Smoking and Smoking Cessation:::Study Description   This study includes samples from two projects: Collaborative Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence (COGEND; PI: Laura Bierut) and University of Wisconsin Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Center (UW-TTURC; PI: Timothy Baker).  Data are available for an additional 1420 COGEND subjects through the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE), dbGaP study accession [phs000092][1]. The majority of these subjects are independent from the current study, but there is a small amount of overlap between the two samples (n=29 subjects) for quality control purposes. It should be noted that the case definition in the SAGE study is DSM-IV alcohol dependence. The case definition in the current study is nicotine dependence by a current score of 4 or greater on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND).  The overall goal of this project is to identify and characterize genetic variants that contribute to the development of nicotine dependence, related smoking behaviors, and smoking cessation. The COGEND sample includes unrelated cases and controls for a genetic association study of nicotine dependence. Cases are defined by a commonly used definition of nicotine dependence, a current score of 4 or more (maximum score of 10) on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). Control status is defined as an individual who smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime, yet never became dependent (lifetime FTND=0). By selecting controls who smoked, those genetic effects that are specific to nicotine dependence can be examined.  The UW-TTURC sample includes nicotine dependent smokers from three smoking cessation studies. Subjects had to smoke at least 10 cigarettes per day (confirmed smoking by an alveolar carbon monoxide (CO) level greater than 9) and report being motivated to quit smoking. Participants were excluded based on evidence of psychosis history, clinically significant depression symptoms, other severe mental illness, or contraindications to smoking cessation medications.  **_COGEND_**: COGEND was initiated in 2001 as a three-part program project grant funded through the National Cancer Institute (NCI; PI: Laura Bierut). The three projects included a study of the familial transmission of nicotine dependence, a genetic study of nicotine dependence, and a study of the relationship of nicotine dependence with nicotine metabolism. The primary goal is to detect, localize, and characterize genes that predispose or protect an individual with respect to heavy tobacco consumption, nicotine dependence, and related phenotypes and to integrate these findings with the family transmission and nicotine metabolism findings. The primary design is a community based case-control family study. Nicotine dependent cases and non- dependent, smoking controls were identified and recruited from Detroit and St. Louis. In addition, one sibling for each case and control subject was recruited in a subset of the sample. More than 54,000 subjects aged 25-44 years were screened by telephone; more than 3,100 subjects were personally interviewed; and more than 2,900 subjects donated blood samples for genetic studies.  **_UW-TTURC_**: The UW-TTURC was initiated in 2001 as a study of nicotine dependence and smoking cessation treatment. The second round of UW-TTURC was initiated in 2005 as a study of efficacy of smoking cessation and long term outcomes. Nicotine dependent smokers seeking cessation treatment were identified and recruited from Madison and Milwaukee, WI. Over 9,000 adult smokers were screened by telephone; 2,575 individuals were enrolled and randomized to treatment conditions that involved use of different smoking cessation medications. Participants from the UW-TTURC smoking cessation clinical trials had the option of participating in a genetic substudy, and approximately 2,000 donated blood samples for genetic studies. The goal of the genetic studies of smokers seeking cessation treatment is to detect, localize, and characterize genes that predispose or protect an individual with respect to heavy tobacco consumption, nicotine dependence, and related phenotypes including cessation, withdrawal, and relapse.  Both studies (COGEND and UW-TTURC) include measures of basic socio-demographic variables, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, family income, and educational attainment. Information on nicotine dependence, as assessed by the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) is available for all subjects. In addition, participants also completed the Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale (NDSS; Shiffman et al., 2004) and the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM-68; Piper et al, 2004). Coding for both individual variables and indices has been standardized across studies. All subjects were assessed in person by trained research assistants.  This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [http://www.genevastudy.org][2]) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to the genetic architecture of smoking through large-scale genome-wide association studies of two well-characterized cohorts. Genotyping was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). Data cleaning and harmonization were done at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.    * Study Weblinks: [COGEND][3]; [UW-TTURC][4]    * Study Types: Case-Control, Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 3499  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000092     [2]: http://www.genevastudy.org     [3]: http://zork.wustl.edu/cogend/     [4]: http://www.ctri.wisc.edu/Researchers/researchers_TTURC.htm  :::Case-Control, Case Set::: 3499:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Nicotine dependent cases were identified during telephone screening as current smokers with a Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) score of 4 or greater (maximum score of 10). Control subjects were identified during telephone screening as smokers (individuals who smoked at least 100 cigarettes lifetime), who never had any symptoms of dependence (lifetime FTND=0). All subjects had to be between the ages of 25 to 44 years and speak English. Subjects could not have a condition that prevented them from providing informed consent or effectively participating in the protocol (e.g., language difficulty, CNS damage, or extremely poor health).  All subjects were assessed using the Semi-Structured Assessment of Nicotine Dependence (SSAND), which was developed specifically for COGEND and is modeled after the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA) and Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).  Data collection ended in 2007; data analysis is ongoing.

phs000348.v1.p1::: Towards a Genomic Understanding of Myeloma:::Study Description   This project was designed to describe genetic abnormalities in primary samples from patients with multiple myeloma by next generation sequencing.  We generated sequence data from multiple myeloma (MM) patients analyzing DNA both from tumor cells (purified from bone marrow using CD138 selection as a marker of plasma cells) and from normal peripheral blood cells (either whole blood or Ficoll-purified mononuclear cells). Using massively parallel sequencing technology (Illumina GA-2 or HiSeq)), we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and/or whole-exome sequencing (WES). The initial set currently deposited contains data from 38 MM patients (23 patients surveyed by WGS and 16 patients by WES, with one patient analyzed by both approaches).  Genomes were sampled to high depth, obtaining an average of 33X coverage and 104X coverage for WGS and WES tumors, respectively. The normal samples had similar coverage. Our goal is to help researchers understand the complex genetic landscape of multiple myeloma and provide a resource for the generation of biological hypotheses.    * Study Weblink: [MMRF][1]    * Study Types: Tumor, Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 38  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.themmrf.org/  :::Tumor, Cohort::: 38:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000222.v2.p2::: PREDICT-HD Huntington Disease Study:::Study Description   The purpose of this project is to make clinical measurements from the PREDICT- HD consortium available through the dbGaP mechanism. The phenotype data will first be converted into a community open standard and subsequently exported to dbGaP for archival and open access distribution of the results of the studies. This will permit members of the scientific community to utilize a permanent resource for investigating the interactions of phenotypes upon an international cohort of early Huntington's Disease.  In the version 2 cut of the data we have provided HD CAG repeat lengths for both alleles as well as enrollment age of all participants. We have also generated unique identifiers prospectively compatible with the larger initiative GWAS in Huntington's Disease project (also on DbGaP). As such, the version 1 cut of the data was mainly proof of concept and should be deprecated. Going forward, all updates will add-on to the version 2 cut of the data. We plan to incorporate cortical parcellation and segmentation from imaging analyses with a future data release at a later time.

In this regard, the PREDICT-HD study cohort and database have become international resources and offer an unprecedented opportunity to further examine early HD. The goals of the PREDICT-HD study involve laying the groundwork for the initiation of neuroprotective therapy in order to delay or conceivably prevent the onset of disease. The specific aims were designed to 1) improve prediction of disease diagnosis in healthy individuals using longitudinal measures of plasma, imaging, cognitive performances, motor ratings and psychiatric measures; 2) identify markers of disease progression prior to the clinical diagnosis and to characterize their natural history; and 3) improve the validity and reliability of disease measures upon which the power and sensitivity of multi-site trials and studies depend. Given the worldwide distinctiveness of the study and its importance to the advancement of knowledge in HD and other brain diseases, the improved availability and the dissemination of its data is an important emphasis.  This project proposes to create an extended electronic data capture and data sharing infrastructure to expand data acquisition and distribution procedures that are expected to improve quality control and data usability. The primary aims of the chosen projects are to 1) provide better user experience for participants and clinicians, and 2) streamline data collection, digital curation, and distribution procedures for researchers external to the core PREDICT-HD project. With future versions of this database, we plan to integrate existing clinical trials management software with medical imaging data repositories.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Jane Paulsen, PhD.

phs000199.v1.p1::: Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Control Copy Number Variation (CNV) Study:::Study Description   We present a database of copy number variations (CNVs) detected in 2,026 disease-free individuals, using high-density, SNP-based oligonucleotide microarrays. This large cohort analyzed for CNVs in a single study using a uniform array platform and computational tools, comprises mainly of Caucasians (65.2%) and African-Americans (34.2%), We have catalogued and characterized 54,462 individual CNVs, 77.8% of which were identified in multiple unrelated individuals. These non-unique CNVs mapped to 3,272 distinct regions of genomic variation spanning 5.9% of the genome; 51.5% of these were previously unreported, and >85% are rare. Our annotation and analysis confirmed and extended previously reported correlations between CNVs and several genomic features such as repetitive DNA elements, segmental duplications and genes. We demonstrate the utility of this data set in distinguishing CNVs with pathologic significance from normal variants. Together, this analysis and annotation provides a useful resource to assist with the assessment of CNVs in the contexts of human variation, disease susceptibility, and clinical molecular diagnostics.

phs000355.v1.p1::: Genome Wide Association for Asthma and Lung Function:::Study Description   The SNP Typing for Association with Multiple Phenotypes from Existing Epidemiologic (STAMPEED) asthma project includes subjects with asthma and controls from the Chicago Asthma Genetics Study (CAG), NHLBI multicenter Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) and NHLBI Collaborative Studies on the Genetics of Asthma CSGA (Wake Forest). All studies included European American and African American children and adults with asthma ranging from mild to severe and adult controls. CAG participants were collected at the University of Chicago. SARP participants were recruited at the NHLBI SARP sites with an emphasis on recruiting severe asthmatics (Moore et al, Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 2010, PMID: [19892860][1]). CSGA cases and controls collected by the Wake Forest investigators were also included. Asthma status was based on both a physician's diagnosis and either bronchodilator reversibility or hyper- responsiveness to methacholine as well as less than 5 pack years of smoking. Genotyping was performed on the Illumina 1Mv1 platform, with individual genotypes called using clustering algorithms as implemented in the BeadStudio software by Illumina. The total number of markers following standard QC was 1,025,129. Imputation was performed using the HapMap phase 2, release 21 SNPs using MACH with the phased HapMap CEU and YRI haplotypes as a reference. Case/control association tests for asthma status were performed using logistic regression in R ([http://CRAN.R-project.org/][2]) on genotype dosages, and adjusting for the first principal component from EIGENSTRAT.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 0  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19892860     [2]: http://CRAN.R-project.org/  :::Case-Control::: 0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000100.v3.p1::: The Finland-United States Investigation of NIDDM Genetics (FUSION) Study:::Study Description   The Finland-United States Investigation of NIDDM Genetics (FUSION) study is a long-term effort to identify genetic variants that predispose to type 2 diabetes (T2D) or that impact the variability of T2D-related quantitative traits. The initial effort involved linkage analysis of affected-sibling-pair (ASP) families based on over 5,000 individuals living in Finland, and association fine mapping based on these family members and additional T2D cases and controls. Recently we completed a genome-wide association scan on 1161 T2D cases and 1174 normal glucose tolerant (NGT) controls. Individual- level data is available here for the 919 T2D cases and 787 NGT controls who reconsented to the use of their data or are deceased.

phs000141.v1.p1::: The Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine (SEARCH) Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) of Statin-Induced Myopathy:::Study Description   The ongoing SEARCH (Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine) randomised trial among 12,064 participants with prior myocardial infarction aims to determine whether 80mg simvastatin daily safely produces greater benefits than does 20mg simvastatin daily. During average follow-up of about 6 years among the 6031 participants allocated 80mg simvastatin, there were 98 definite or incipient cases of myopathy; more than half occurred in the first year and all made a full recovery. We hypothesised that similarly strong associations might exist between myopathy with high-dose statin regimens and genetic variants, especially those affecting blood statin levels.  This genome-wide association study was restricted to the 96 myopathy cases (48 definite; 48 incipient) diagnosed while taking 80mg simvastatin daily within SEARCH with buffy coat samples available. Among the remaining participants allocated 80mg simvastatin, 96 controls were selected with matching for sex, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate and amiodarone use at baseline. Cases and controls were not known to be related; one case who had classified himself as of non-European ancestry was excluded. We obtained adequate DNA from 85 cases and 90 controls, and these samples were genotyped with the Sentrix HumanHap300-Duo BeadChip (Illumina) with 318,237 SNPs, and 316,184 (99.4%) SNPs passed data quality checks. Case-control associations of myopathy with these SNPs were evaluated.

phs000537.v1.p1::: Next Generation Mendelian Genetics: Familial Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis:::Study Description   The NHGRI Next Generation Mendelian Genetics project uses exome resequencing to identify variants in unsolved Mendelian diseases.  Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (fHLH) is a serious immune disorder that results from defective cytotoxic lymphocyte function. Autosomal recessive mutations in PFP1, UNC13D, STX11, STBP2, or RAB27, and hemizygous mutations in SH2D1A or BIRC4, account for known causes of the disease, but 30-70% of patients in North America lack a known genetic etiology.

Families will be characterized clinically and blood samples will be collected to establish cell lines. If a blood sample is not available, autopsy samples will be collected for DNA extraction and storage. Our goal is to recruit 1,000 families over the course of the study. Clinical and demographic data from these families will be collected at the local site and coded data, without identifiers, will be sent and included in a national database of families with Alzheimer&#39;s Disease. This database, along with the biological samples, will be housed at the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer&#39;s Disease (NCRAD) at Indiana University. The Center or provider and the Cell Repository must sign a Material Transfer Agreement for shipment of biological samples and phenotypic data to NCRAD. The biological samples and data from these families will be available to qualified researchers, who must sign a Material Transfer Agreement before receiving DNA and data. An oversight committee known as the Cell Bank Advisory Committee (CBAC) will review and monitor the process of family identification and enrollment, data collection, the establishment of cell lines and access to samples.<p>  **LOAD CIDR Project**  >The first 362 families of the Multiplex Family Study (including 2,105 family members) were included in a 6K SNP genome-wide scan at the NIH-supported, Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). An additional 297 unrelated, healthy controls were also genotyped at CIDR. The average age of onset of AD in the genotyped sample is 74 years and 62% of the sample is women. While primarily Caucasian, 3% are African-American, and 3% are of Hispanic ancestry. 72% of the families had at least 2 affected siblings, whereas 21% had 3 or more sampled affected individuals and 7% had 4 or more genotyped, affected family members.<p>    * Study Weblink: [The Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Initiative][1]    * Study Types: Family, Control Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 2398  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://niageneticsinitiative.org  :::Family, Control Set::: 2398:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

For tier 1, we individually genotyped 198,345 uniformly spaced and informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 443 sibling pairs discordant for PD. For tier 2a, we individually genotyped 1,793 PD-associated SNPs (P<.01 in tier 1) and 300 genomic control SNPs in 332 matched case- unrelated control pairs. We identified 11 SNPs that were associated with PD (P<.01) in both tier 1 and tier 2 samples and had the same direction of effect. For these SNPs, we combined data from the case-unaffected sibling pair (tier 1) and case-unrelated control pair (tier 2) samples and employed a liberalization of the sibling transmission/disequilibrium test to calculate odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and P values. A SNP within the semaphorin 5A gene (SEMA5A) had the lowest combined P value (P=7.62E-6). The protein encoded by this gene plays an important role in neurogenesis and in neuronal apoptosis, which is consistent with existing hypotheses regarding PD pathogenesis. A second SNP tagged the PARK11 late-onset PD susceptibility locus (P=1.70E-5). In tier 2b, we also selected for genotyping additional SNPs that were borderline significant (P<.05) in tier 1 but that tested a priori biological and genetic hypotheses regarding susceptibility to PD (n=941 SNPs). In analysis of the combined tier 1 and tier 2b data, the two SNPs with the lowest P values (P=9.07E-6; P=2.96E-5) tagged the PARK10 late-onset PD susceptibility locus. Independent replication across populations will clarify the role of the genomic loci tagged by these SNPs in conferring PD susceptibility.  Note: The following instruments were used: 1)clinical assessments form and manual; 2) sibling screening form and manual; 3) unrelated control screening and manual; and 4) risk factors questionnaire and manual. All cases underwent #1, as did sibling controls screening positive (see below). Unrelated controls were not examined. All siblings underwent #2. All unrelated controls underwent #3.

They all resided within Minnesota or one of the surrounding four states (Wisconsin, Iowa, South Dakota, or North Dakota). All cases underwent a standardized clinical assessment performed by a neurologist sub-specialized in movement disorders. Cases had at least two of four cardinal signs of parkinsonism (rest tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and/or postural instability) and no features atypical for PD (such as unexplained upper motor neuron signs or cerebellar signs). When non-motor manifestations such as dysautonomia or dementia were present, they were mild and occurred late in the disease course. Subjects with secondary causes of parkinsonism (e.g., history of neuroleptic exposure, encephalitis, or multiple strokes) were excluded. All patients treated with a daily dosage total of 1 g of levodopa (in combination with carbidopa) had a more than minimal improvement in parkinsonism symptoms and signs.  Criteria for Controls: Unaffected siblings of cases, matched on gender when able then on closest age at study (tier 1); or unrelated population controls, matched on gender and age at study (tier 2).

phs000124.v2.p1::: Neuroblastoma Genome-Wide Association Study (NBL-GWAS):::Study Description   Neuroblastoma is a malignancy of the developing sympathetic nervous system that most commonly affects young children and is often lethal. The etiology of this embryonal cancer is not known.  We have performed a whole genome scan for association of neuroblastoma with SNP genotypes and copy number variation to discover predisposition loci.  We therefore initiated a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 2007 focused on neuroblastoma patients identified through the Children's Oncology Group (COG; 238 member institutions). Control patients for this study are children cared for at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) without a diagnosis of cancer. The study was designed to collect up to 5000 neuroblastoma cases and 10,000 controls and is powered to detect common susceptibility variants in Caucasian and African American patients.

phs000380.v1.p1::: eMERGE Genome-Wide Association Studies of Obesity (Metabochip):::Study Description   ** Important Links and Information **    * [Data Use Certification Agreement][1]    * [Apply for Authorized Access ][2]    * [Acknowledgement Statements][3]  The Geisinger eMERGE Genome Wide Association Studies of Obesity (Metabochip) Project is a genetic study of a cohort of primarily Caucasian patients with extreme obesity who have undergone bariatric surgery. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, in which intestinal anatomy is altered, dramatically ameliorates and/or eliminates Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in 50-80% of patients within hours to days following surgery, well before significant weight loss, in contrast to other types of bariatric surgeries, such as gastric banding, that attenuate insulin resistance as a result of substantial weight loss that occurs over months to years. The molecular mechanism by which RYGB exerts this clinical phenomenon is not known. The goal of this project was to conduct a genome wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants associated with amelioration in T2D defined by medication independence. Identifying genetic variants that influence the dramatic resolution of T2D from RYGB may identify novel targets for pharmacological T2D therapies and/or identify patients in whom RYGB may not be effective.    * Study Weblink: [The eMERGE Network][4]    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 982  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000380.v1.p1     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [3]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=eMERGE_Acknowledgement.pdf     [4]: https://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/victr/dcc/projects/acc/index.php/Main_Page  :::Case Set::: 982:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000413.v2.p1::: Analysis of Somatic Mutations in Pediatric AML FAB-M7 Subtype by Whole Transcriptome Sequencing:::Study Description   High resolution analysis of DNA copy number abnormalities and loss-of- heterozygosity on acute myeloblastic leukemia samples utilizing SNP arrays has demonstrated that in contrast to pediatric ALL, de novo AML is characterized by a very low burden of genomic alterations (Radtke, et al., PNAS, 2009). Samples for this study represented a cross-section of the different subtypes of pediatric AML. The only AML subtype that was an outlier from the above observations was acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AML FAB-M7), with the majority of these cases being characterized by complex chromosomal rearrangements and a high number of copy number alterations. To more fully define the genomic landscape of this subtype, we performed transcriptome sequence analysis on 14 pediatric FAB-M7 cases and mutation recurrence screening in a panel of 62 adult and pediatric AML FAB-M7 samples using the Illumina platform. Our results identified chromosomal rearrangements resulting in the expression of novel fusion transcripts in 11/14 cases. Remarkably, in 7/14 cases we detected an inversion on chromosome 16 that results in the juxtaposition of the CBFA2T3 gene next to the GLIS2 gene resulting in a CBFA2T3-GLIS2 chimeric gene that encoded an in frame fusion protein. This fusion led to the acquisition or preservation of self-renewal in colony forming assays, providing functional evidence for a role in leukemogenesis. In addition to novel chimeric transcripts, we found mutations in genes previously identified to play a role in megakaryoblastic leukemia that carry a proliferative advantage to the cell, such as JAK2 and MPL. These data demonstrate that AML FAB-M7 is characterized by cooperating Class I and Class II mutations leading to leukemogenesis.    * Study Types: Case Set, Cohort, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 15  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set, Cohort, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal::: 15:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000268.v1.p1::: Genotyping NIGMS CEPH Samples from the United States, Venezuela, and France:::Study Description   The Human Genetic Cell Repository (HGCR) is sponsored by the [National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)][1] with the mission of supplying scientists with the materials for accelerating disease gene discovery and functional studies. The resources available include highly- characterized, contaminant-free fibroblast cell lines, transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), and DNA samples derived from these cultures. While the Repository has a major emphasis on inherited diseases, it also contains large collections of cell lines gathered from populations around the world that are intended for use in facilitating the understanding of human variation. Prominent among these resources is the CEPH Reference Family collection contributed by the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain ([CEPH][2]), Foundation Jean Dausset, Paris, France. The CEPH collection includes families collected by R. White (Utah), J. Dausset (French), J. Gusella (Venezuelan), and J. Egeland (Amish). There are a total of 809 individuals accounting for 832 pedigree positions in the reference families. Family relationships for the 61 reference families were verified at Coriell and approved by CEPH. In an effort to enhance the value of this cell culture resource available from the Repository, the Coriell Genotyping and Microarray Center used the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 platform to genotype 181 samples from the NIGMS HGCR CEPH collection. Included are thirteen families from the United States (Amish Pedigree 884 and Utah Pedigrees 1331, 1356, 1400, 1416, 1424, 1427, 1477, and 1582), France (Pedigrees 35 and 66), and Venezuela (Pedigrees 102 and 104). Twelve of the families consist of 3 generations and one family consists of 2 generations.

phs000366.v1.p1::: NHLBI: Genetic modifiers of sickle cell anemia severity and fetal hemoglobin expression in the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD):::Study Description   Phenotypic heterogeneity is characteristic of sickle cell anemia, a Mendelian disorder caused by homozygosity for the sickle HBB gene (glu6val). Patients have different rates of hemolysis/vasculopathy and viscosity/vasoocclusion- related complications. These complications account for a substantial reduction in life expectancy. In 1994, the median life expectancy for men and women with sickle cell anemia was 42 and 48 years, respectively, and despite many advances in care, the annual mortality still approaches 4%. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is one of the most studied markers of severity of sickle cell anemia, and detailed longitudinal measurements were taken on subjects enrolled in the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD). Cubic root transformation of the median values from follow-up in 848 African American subjects is the phenotype data used in the GWAS of fetal hemoglobin. The analysis was adjusted by sex. Details are in Solovieff et al., Blood 2010 [PMID: [20018918][1]].  To integrate individual disease complications into a comprehensive measure of severity, we developed a model of the associations among clinical and laboratory variables that scored disease severity as the risk of death within 5 years. This network was developed using data obtained from more than 3,400 subjects from the CSSCD, and its accuracy was validated in two unrelated sets of sickle cell patients. Recently, the network was also validated in a small European cohort of patients with sickle cell anemia. We used extreme values of disease severity as cases and control in the GWAS of severity of sickle cell anemia. We conducted the GWAS in 1,265 patients with either "severe" (177) or "mild" disease (1088) based on a network model of disease severity. Details are in Sebastiani et al.

The primary motivation for the study was the lack of systematically obtained knowledge about this prevalent and costly hereditary disease. Although the molecular and genetic features of sickle cell disease have been known for years and many of its manifestations have been recognized, the clinical course from birth to death is not well understood. This is largely due to the variable degree of severity, the variability of the many manifestations, and the complexity of the interaction of the disease process with other health-related events. Therefore, information obtained was largely anecdotal, retrospective in nature, and lacking statistical validity. There were many unanswered questions about this disease.  In 1978, the Division of Blood Diseases and Resources established a multi- institutional study, the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease, to answer these questions. During the first 10 years of the study (October 1978 through September 1988), 4,085 patients from 23 clinical centers within the United States were enrolled in the study. Patient entry was completed in 1981 for all except patients less than 6 months of age who continued to enter the study through September 1988. Protocol requirements for patients during the original study varied depending on age, phenotype, and time period. In 1989, a 5-year study (Phase 2) to continue follow-up of two patient groups (the infant cohort (patients entered at < 6 months of age in Phase 1) and adults 35 years of age and older) was initiated. During Phase 2, the objectives for the original infant cohort were 1) to identify factors related to overall disease severity, 2) to determine the onset of early organ damage, and 3) to examine risk factors contributing to certain complications and outcomes. The primary areas of interest for this cohort were the brain and lungs. A 5-year follow-up study (Phase 3) was initiated in 1994 to continue collecting these data to allow for longer longitudinal evaluation of factors affecting overall disease severity, brain abnormalities, neurocognitive and psychosocial functioning, and pulmonary dysfunction.

phs000305.v1.p1::: A Genome-Wide Association Study in Participants Experiencing Breast Cancer Events in High-Risk Postmenopausal Women Receiving Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators on NSABP Trials P-1 and P-2. A Collaboration Between the NIH Pharmacogenetics Research Network and the RIKEN Yokohama Institute Center for Genomic Medicine:::Study Description   The primary aim of this study is to identify genes related to the occurrence of breast events, defined as occurrence of invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), in women at high risk of developing breast cancer who have received a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM - tamoxifen or raloxifene) on the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) P-1 or P-2 trials. Cases and controls were selected from the tamoxifen arm in the P-1 and from the tamixifen and raloxifene arms in the P-2 trial. For the P-1 trial, cases and controls were required to be 50 years of age or older at time of entry. Cases were females who experienced an invasive breast cancer or DCIS on P-1 or P-2. Controls were females who did not experience an invasive breast cancer or DCIS.  A nested matched case-control design was used, with matching on the following factors: 1) trial and treatment arm (P-1 tamoxifen, P-2 tamoxifen, P-2 raloxifene); 2) age at trial entry (when controls could not be exactly matched on age, we incremented the age of matching by +/- 1 year, in sequence until a match was obtained without exceeding +/- 5 years); 5-year predicted breast cancer risk based on the Gail model ( <2.00%, 2.01-3.00, 3.01-5.00, >5.01), 3) history of lobular carcinoma in situ (yes vs. no); 4) history of atypical hyperplasia in breast (yes vs. no); 5) time on study (controls must be on study at least as long as the time to diagnosis of the breast event for the case). Because 94.2% of the participants on P-1 and P-2 treated with tamoxifen or raloxifene were Caucasian, this study was restricted to only Caucasians.  Two cases and two controls were randomly chosen as duplicates for quality control of genotype concordance. The DNA samples were plated into 96-well plates, with cases and controls randomly distributed across the plates. A Caucasian parent-child CEPH trio from the HapMap project was included to check for Mendelian transmission of alleles. Genotypes were determined by the RIKEN Center for Genomic Medicine with the Illumina Human610-Quad.    * Study Type: Nested Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1763  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Nested Case-Control::: 1763:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000392.v1.p1::: Exome sequencing of autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia (arPEO):::Study Description   Progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) is an inherited mitochondrial disease that follows either autosomal dominant or recessive forms of inheritance (adPEO or arPEO). AdPEO is a genetically heterogeneous disease and several genes including _POLG1_ and _C10orf2_/Twinkle have been identified as responsible genes. On the other hand, _POLG1_ was the only established gene causing arPEO with mitochondrial DNA deletions. We previously reported a case of PEO with unidentified genetic etiology. The patient was born of a first- cousin marriage. Therefore, the recessive form of inheritance was suspected. To identify the disease causing variant in this patient, we subjected the patient's DNA to whole-exome sequencing and narrowed down the candidate variants using public data and runs of homozygosity analysis.    * Study Types: Exome Sequencing, Single Patient    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Exome Sequencing, Single Patient::: 1:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000581.v1.p1::: NHLBI GO-ESP: Family Studies (Dilated Cardiomyopathy):::Study Description   The NHLBI "Grand Opportunity" Exome Sequencing Project (GO-ESP), a signature project of the NHLBI Recovery Act investment, was designed to identify genetic variants in coding regions (exons) of the human genome (the "exome") that are associated with heart, lung and blood diseases. These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied. These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease, contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention and treatments to specific populations. This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects. GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers - BroadGO and SeattleGO.  The goals for this project are to conduct exome sequencing for novel dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) gene discovery in families with DCM. These families have already been sequenced for 15 DCM genes, accounting for approximately 75% of known genetic cause, without rare coding variants identified.    * Study Weblink: [NHLBI Grand Opportunity Exome Sequencing Project (ESP)][1]    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 49  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://esp.gs.washington.edu/drupal/  :::Case Set::: 49:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

We most commonly use an echocardiographic (echo)-derived left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) to determine LVE, where the LVEDD is derived from sex- and height-specific partitioning values from the Framingham study. We also note that some FDC families present with prominent conduction system disease (e.g., LMNA or SCN5A mutations), and in such cases it may be appropriate to use additional diagnostic criteria for affected status as was done by Olson and colleagues for SCN5A mapping and as recommended by the European working group.  :::SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library v2.0:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Cardiomyopathy, Dilated ][1]    * [ Familial dilated cardiomyopathy ][2]    * [ Idiopathic dilation cardiomyopathy ][3]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68002311[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =67536231[uid]     [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =67536277[uid]  :::Study History   The central goal of this study has been to discover genetic cause of DCM. In 1992 the plan was to identify and phenotype very large multiplex families with FDC for genome-wide linkage analysis and gene mapping studies. With first NIH funding in 1998, we expanded recruitment to FDC families of all sizes to acquire a well-phenotyped DCM genetic repository so that with identification of a novel DCM gene we would be able to search for allelic variants, thereby gaining evidence to support its relevance. As FDC genes were discovered, we began to rule out rare variants in the known FDC genes by Sanger sequencing in our large families in order to triage the time and resource intensive genotyping and linkage effort into large pedigrees with unknown genetic cause. By 2006 we had phenotyped >300 DCM probands from families of all sizes with well established family screening, phenotyping and recontact protocols. Our current studies are using exome sequencing to identify novel DCM genes in families negative for mutations in 16 known DCM genes.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Ray E Hershberger.

phs000567.v1.p1::: Identification of Recurrent NAB2-STAT6 Gene Fusions in Solitary Fibrous Tumor by Integrative Sequencing:::Study Description   Transcriptome sequencing of solitary fibrous tumors / hemangiopericytomas from a variety of anatomic sites revealed recurrent gene fusions between two genes, NAB2 and STAT6. All SFTs examined exhibited an in-frame fusion transcript encoding a fusion protein containing the EGR1 interaction domain of NAB2 with the transcriptional activation domain of STAT6. Functional testing of the fusion alleles confirmed the conversion of the wt NAB2 repressor into a transcriptional activator. A range of individual fusion junctions can be detected by next-generation sequencing acro the sample set, highlighting the suitability of this method in the diagnostic characterization of SFTs. This study indentified the pathognomonic alteration in solitary fibrous tumors and illuminates a pathway towards targeted therapeutics for this cancer.    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 26  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set::: 26:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000455.v1.p1::: Molecular Genetic Studies of Developmental Brain Disorders:::Study Description   Study 1  > 2R01-NS050375 (PI: DOBYNS, William B.)<br> The genetic basis of mid- hindbrain malformations  > Our general goal for this project is to advance our understanding of human developmental disorders that involve the brainstem and cerebellum - brain structures derived from the embryonic midbrain and hindbrain - that affect a minimum of 2.4 per 1000 resident births based on data from the CDC. Importantly, this large class of disorders co-occurs with more common developmental disorders such as autism, mental retardation and some forms of infantile epilepsy, and shares some of the same causes. With this renewal, we propose to expand the scope of our work beyond single phenotypes and genes to focus on delineating the critical phenotype spectra to which the most common MHM belong, and defining the underlying biological networks that are disrupted. <p>  To pursue these goals, we will use our large and growing cohort of human subjects to map additional MHM loci using SNP microarrays that provide both high-resolution autozygosity and linkage data in informative families as well as detect critical copy number variants in sporadic subjects. The causative genes will be identified using traditional Sanger or new high-throughput sequencing methods as appropriate abased on size of the critical region. We will use these and other known MHM causative genes to construct and revise model biological networks of genes and proteins, and test these genes and networks in additional patients as a candidate gene or more accurately a candidate network approach. These approaches need to be supported by ongoing active subject recruitment, as studies of comparable disorders such as mental retardation and autism have benefited from even larger numbers of subjects that we have so far collected. We need to use new high-throughput sequencing methods to more efficiently test larger critical regions, and to test entire gene networks rather than individual genes in matched cohorts of subjects. At every step; phenotype analysis, CNV analysis, model network construction and high-throughput sequencing, we will need expanded bioinformatics capabilities. Finally, we need to test the biological function of new genes and networks to support our gene identification studies. We expect that these studies will contribute immediately to more accurate diagnosis and counseling, and over time will lead to development of specific treatments for a subset of these disorders. We further expect that studies of mid-hindbrain development will have broad significance for human developmental disorders generally, providing compelling evidence for a connection between cerebellar development and other classes of developmental disorders such as autism, mental retardation and epilepsy.  Study 2  > R01-NS058721 (PI: DOBYNS, William B.)<br> De novo copy number variation and gene discovery in human brain malformations  > Project SummaryAbstract  > The number of recognized brain malformations and syndromes has grown rapidly during the past several decades, yet relatively few causative genes have been identified, especially for three common malformations that have been associated with numerous cytogenetically visible chromosome deletions and duplications, and that often occur together: agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), cerebellar vermis hypoplasia (CVH) including Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM), and polymicrogyria (PMG). We propose to perform high-resolution array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH), emerging technology able to detect small copy number variants (CNV), in 700 probands with one or more of these three malformations. Our central hypothesis states that more than 10% of patients with ACC, CVH or PMG will have <i>de novo<i> CNV below the resolution of routine cytogenetic analysis, but detectable by current array platforms. We therefore expect to identify 70-100 patients with small CNV. We will distinguish CNV found in normal individuals from potentially disease- associated changes, and will confirm CNV using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and microsatellite (STRP) analysis. We will give highest priority to CNV that are _de novo_ and involve 2 or more BACs, and secondary priority to familial and smaller CNV excluding known polymorphisms. After that, we will evaluate and rank candidate genes in the critical regions using information from public databases and our own expression studies, and perform mutation analysis of the best candidate genes from well-defined critical regions by sequencing in a large panel of subjects with phenotypes that match the phenotypes of the patients whose CNV define the critical regions. Here, we will use more refined criteria to supplement our clinical classification, such as the developmental level and presence of epilepsy or other birth defects. Any abnormalities found will be analyzed using existing data regarding polymorphisms (i.e. dbSNP), cross-species comparisons, and functional assays appropriate for the specific sequence change.  Study 2A  > In 1995, we described a novel multiple congenital anomaly syndrome associated with facial dysmorphism (congenital ptosis, high arched eyebrows, shallow orbits, trigonocephaly), colobomas of the eyes, neuronal migration malformation (frontal predominant lissencephaly) and variable hearing loss. We hypothesized from <i>de novo<i> mutations and used trio-based exome sequencing to identify _de novo_ mutations in the ACTB and ACTG1 genes.  Study 2B  > In 1997 and 2004, we and others defined two novel developmental syndromes associated with markedly enlarged brain size, or megalencephaly, and other highly recognizable features. The megalencephaly-capillary malformation syndrome (MCAP) consists of megalencephaly and associated growth dysregulation with variable asymmetry, developmental vascular anomalies, distal limb malformations, variable cortical malformation, and a mild connective tissue dysplasia. The megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome (MPPH) resembles MCAP but lacks vascular malformations and syndactyly. We hypothesized that MCAP and MPPH result from mutations - including postzygotic events - in the same pathway, and studied them together. Using a combination of exome sequencing, Sanger sequencing, restriction-enzyme assays, and targeted ultra-deep sequencing in 50 families with MCAP or MPPH, we identified <i>de novo<i> germline or postzygotic mutations in three core components of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT pathway. These include two mutations in AKT3, a recurrent mutation in PIK3R2, and multiple mostly postzygotic mutations in PIK3CA (Riviere JB, Mirzaa GM, O'Roak BJ, Beddaoui M, Alcantara D, Conway RL, St-Onge J, Schwartzentruber JA, Gripp KW, Nikkel SM, Worthylake T, Sullivan CT, Ward TR, Butler HE, Kramer NA, Albrecht B, Armour CM, Armstrong L, Caluseriu O, Cytrynbaum C, Drolet BA, Innes AM, Lauzon JL, Lin AE, Mancini GMS, Meschino WS, Reggin JD, Saggar AK, Lerman-Sagie T, Uyanik G, Weksberg R, Zirn B, Beaulieu CL, FORGE Canada Consortium, Majewski J, Bulman DE, O'Driscoll M, Shendure J, Graham Jr. JM, Boycott KM, Dobyns WB. _De novo_ germline and postzygotic mutations in AKT3, PIK3R2 and PIK3CA cause a spectrum of related megalencephaly syndromes.

phs000306.v3.p1::: A Multiethnic Genome-wide Scan of Prostate Cancer:::Study Description   Multiple GWA studies of prostate cancer conducted in European White populations are ongoing. These studies will continue to have a dramatic impact on our understanding of the contribution of common genetic variation on inter- individual susceptibility to this common cancer. Important questions that will remain unanswered, however, are whether all common risk alleles for prostate cancer will be revealed in studies limited to populations of European ancestry. A comprehensive examination of common genetic variation in men of Japanese, Latino, and African ancestry will be required to understand population differences in disease risk and to reveal the full spectrum of causal alleles that exist in these populations. Further, genetic and environmental diversity is likely to contribute to ethnic heterogeneity of genetic effects. Elucidating gene x gene and gene x environment interactions is also likely to provide knowledge that may be critical for understanding the contribution of genetic susceptibility to racial/ethnic disparities in prostate cancer incidence and for translating the findings from GWA studies into interventions.  In this study we plan to undertake a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of prostate cancer in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study. We propose the following hypotheses: (a) that inherited DNA variation influences risk of prostate cancer; (b) that many of the causal alleles will be outside known "candidate genes" requiring an agnostic, comprehensive search; and (c) that performing this search in a multi-ethnic cohort is more powerful than a study limited to a single population to reveal the full range of causal alleles relevant to the U.S. population.  The version 1 release of this dataset will include genotype data for the Japanese and Latino populations in the study. The version 2 release will include data for the African ancestry population along with the Japanese and Latino subjects. The version 3 release will include fully-cleaned genotype data for all three populations.  This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [http://www.genevastudy.org][1]) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to prostate cancer through large-scale genome-wide association studies of a well-characterized multi-ethnic cohort. Genotyping was performed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, a GENEVA genotyping center and at the University of Southern California. Data cleaning and harmonization were performed at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington. As an add-on to this GWAS we performed a targeted re-sequencing of all known prostate cancer risk loci in the samples from the MEC. Sequencing was performed in Dr. Reich's lab at Harvard Medical School.    * Study Types: Nested Case-Control, Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 9457  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.genevastudy.org  :::Nested Case-Control, Cohort::: 9457:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000096.v4.p1::: Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) Study - Maternal Glycemia and Birthweight GEI Study:::Study Description   ** Important Links and Information **    * [Instructions][1] to request Authorized Access    * [Data Use Certification Agreement][2]    * [Apply for Authorized Access ][3]  Low and high birth weight are not only major causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality, but epidemiological data have established an association between birth weight and later life risk of adult metabolic diseases. Fetal growth is determined by complex interactions between fetal genes and the maternal uterine environment. Subtle or overt variation in maternal glucose tolerance, which is, in part, genetically determined, is related to fetal size at birth. Moreover, new emerging data suggest that genetic variation in the fetus can impact maternal metabolism (e.g., blood pressure and glucose tolerance). Given the above, we are addressing the hypothesis that, during pregnancy, gene- environment interactions in the context of the maternal-fetal unit impact fetal size at birth and maternal metabolism. Genes that control fetal growth or maternal metabolism during pregnancy are largely unknown, so the first step to address our hypothesis will be to identify genetic variation that impacts fetal growth and maternal metabolism and to determine the interaction of that variation with the intrauterine and fetal environment.  To accomplish this, we are performing genome wide association (GWA) mapping on a subset of ~37,000 DNA samples that were collected from mothers and their offspring as part of the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) Study. HAPO is a multicenter, international study in which high quality phenotypic data related to fetal growth and maternal glucose metabolism has been collected from 25,000 pregnant women of varied racial and socio- demographic backgrounds using standardized protocols that were uniform across centers. For these studies, we are genotyping 1,500 infants and their mothers of European descent, 1,250 Afro-Caribbean infants and mothers, 800 Hispanic (Mexican-American) infants and mothers, and 1200 Thai infants and mothers. Genotyping is being performed using the Illumina Human610 Quad (European ancestry participants), Human1M Duo (Afro-Caribbean and Hispanic participants), and Omni1-Quad_v1-0_B (Thai participants).  The specific aims for the project are as follows: (1) To apply analytic approaches for conducting GWA mapping studies on quantitative phenotypes related to offspring size at birth (birth weight, ponderal index, head circumference and adiposity) allowing for other known influences such as gestational age, parity, and maternal weight gain. (2) To apply the above approaches to identify genetic variation that impacts maternal glucose tolerance at ~28 weeks of gestation (fasting glucose, glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test, and insulin sensitivity expressed as quantitative traits) allowing for other known influences such as maternal weight gain, parity and age. (3) To examine the interaction between maternal genes, the intrauterine environment, and fetal genes to identify interactions that modulate genetic regulation of size at birth and fetal genetic variation that impacts on maternal glucose tolerance. GWA mapping will provide initial evidence for association of specific SNPs with the quantitative traits outlined above.  As low and high birth weight are not only major causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality but have also been associated with increased risk of metabolic diseases in adults, identification of genes that regulate fetal growth and maternal metabolism will provide novel information about the pathways that regulate these processes as well as important insight into susceptibility genes for chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes.  The Version 1 (v1) dbGaP release will include data only from the Hispanic study participants. The Version 2 (v2) dbGaP release will include data from the Hispanic and European ancestry study participants. The Version 3 (v3) dbGaP release will include data from the Afro-Caribbean, Hispanic and European ancestry participants. The Version 4 (v4) dbGaP release will include data from all participants (i.e., Afro-Caribbean, Hispanic, European ancestry, and Thai participants).  This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [http://www.genevastudy.org][4]) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to maternal metabolism and birthweight through large-scale genome-wide association studies of infants and their mothers at multiple international sites. Genotyping was performed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and at CIDR of Johns Hopkins University, GENEVA genotyping centers.

EGAS00000000055::: Procardis study on novel susceptibility genes for coronary artery disease (CAD):::Study Description       An increased level of Lp(a) lipoprotein has been identified as a risk factor for coronary artery disease that is highly heritable. The genetic determinants of the Lp(a) lipoprotein level and their relevance for the risk of coronary disease are incompletely understood. METHODS: We used a novel gene chip containing 48,742 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2100 candidate genes to test for associations in 3145 case subjects with coronary disease and 3352 control subjects. Replication was tested in three independent populations involving 4846 additional case subjects with coronary disease and 4594 control subjects. RESULTS: Three chromosomal regions (6q26-27, 9p21, and 1p13) were strongly associated with the risk of coronary disease. The LPA locus on 6q26-27 encoding Lp(a) lipoprotein had the strongest association. We identified a common variant (rs10455872) at the LPA locus with an odds ratio for coronary disease of 1.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49 to 1.95) and another independent variant (rs3798220) with an odds ratio of 1.92 (95% CI, 1.48 to 2.49). Both variants were strongly associated with an increased level of Lp(a) lipoprotein, a reduced copy number in LPA (which determines the number of kringle IV-type 2 repeats), and a small Lp(a) lipoprotein size. Replication studies confirmed the effects of both variants on the Lp(a) lipoprotein level and the risk of coronary disease. A meta-analysis showed that with a genotype score involving both LPA SNPs, the odds ratios for coronary disease were 1.51 (95% CI, 1.38 to 1.66) for one variant and 2.57 (95% CI, 1.80 to 3.67) for two or more variants. After adjustment for the Lp(a) lipoprotein level, the association between the LPA genotype score and the risk of coronary disease was abolished. CONCLUSIONS: We identified two LPA variants that were strongly associated with both an increased level of Lp(a) lipoprotein and an increased risk of coronary disease. Our findings provide support for a causal role of Lp(a) lipoprotein in coronary disease.    * Study Weblink: [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000055][1]    * Study Type: GWAS    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access:  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000055  :::GWAS:::0::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: 
phs000239.v2.p1::: Genome, epigenome and RNA sequences of monozygotic twins discordant for multiple sclerosis:::Study Description   Monozygotic (MZ) twins have been widely employed for dissection of the relative contributions of genetics and environment in disease. In multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune demyelinating disease that commonly causes neurodegeneration and disability in young adults, disease discordance in MZ twins has been interpreted to indicate environmental importance in pathogenesis. However, genetic and epigenetic differences between MZ twins have been described, challenging the accepted experimental paradigm in disambiguating effects of nature and nurture. Here, we report the genome sequences of one MS-discordant MZ twin pair and messenger RNA (mRNA) transcriptome and epigenome sequences of CD4+ lymphocytes from three MS- discordant, MZ twin pairs. No reproducible differences were detected between co-twins among ~3.6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or ~0.2 million insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels). Nor were any reproducible differences observed between siblings of the three twin pairs in HLA haplotypes, confirmed MS-susceptibility SNPs, copy number variations, mRNA and genomic SNP and indel genotypes, or expression of ~19,000 genes in CD4+ T cells. Only two to 176 differences in methylation of ~2 million CpG sites were detected between siblings of the three twin pairs, in contrast to ~800 differences in methylation between T cells of unrelated individuals and several thousand differences between tissues or normal and cancerous tissues. In the first systematic effort to estimate sequence variation among MZ co- twins, we did not find evidence for genetic, epigenetic or transcriptome differences that explained disease discordance. These are the first female, twin and autoimmune disease genome sequences reported.    * Study Types: Case-Control, Monozygotic Twins    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 6  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control, Monozygotic Twins::: 6:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

We used massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies to screen entire genomes, in an unbiased manner, for genetic changes associated with tumor growth and metastasis. We describe the complete genome sequence analysis of four DNA samples from a 44-year old African-American patient with basal-like breast cancer: peripheral blood, the primary tumor, a brain metastasis that developed within a year of initial therapy, and a first-passage xenograft derived from the primary tumor. A total of 50 validated mutations were discovered within coding, RNA, or splice site sequences. Of these, 20 mutations were abundantly present in all three tumors, including mutations in _CSMD1_ and _JAK2_. These two genes subsequently were found to be mutated in other breast tumors. The metastasis contained two _de novo_ mutations not present in the primary tumor, and was significantly enriched for 20 shared mutations, suggesting that they may be involved in the metastatic process. The xenograft contained no unique coding, RNA, or splice site mutations and retained all primary tumor mutations, albeit at different frequencies. However, a significant increase in copy number alterations was observed in the xenograft as compared to the primary tumor. We validated 28 large deletions and six inversions, as well as seven translocations in at least one of the three tumor samples. Among them, a 26 kb deletion in _MECR_ was solely identified, assembled, and validated in the brain metastasis and two overlapping large deletions on chromosome 5 encompassing _CTNNA1_, a potential tumor suppressor gene, were identified in all three tumors. The differential mutation frequencies and structural variation patterns between primary and metastatic tumors suggest that metastatic tumors may arise from minor subpopulations of cells within the primary. Namely, the metastatic and xenografting processes apparently select for cells harboring a distinct subset of the primary tumor mutation repertoire.    * Study Weblink: [The Genome Center at Washington University][4]    * Study Types: Tumor vs. Matched-Normal, Metastasis, Xenograft    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=NHGRI_DAC_Supplemental_Instruction.pdf     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000245.v1.p1     [3]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [4]: http://genome.wustl.edu/cancer/breast  :::Tumor vs. Matched-Normal, Metastasis, Xenograft::: 1:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000245  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   This patient sample set represented a unique opportunity to investigate several interesting questions that directly impinge upon clinical understanding and basic science research into cancer biology. In the first area, clinical understanding, it is fairly rare to obtain a metastatic sample from a patient whose primary tumor and a matched normal were already banked. In this case, the metastatic sample was even more rare, as brain tumors are typically not removed, due to the traumatic impact of neurosurgery. The particular clinical understanding gained from studying a set of samples from the same patient that included normal, primary disease and metastatic disease is enormous due to the rarity of these sample sets, as indicated, and due to the exquisite detail obtained by whole genome sequencing. In the context of basic science research, this patient had a portion of her primary tumor, prior to any chemotherapy, placed into a NOD/SCID mouse for propagation and further study as an HIM (human-in-mouse) xenograft. While scientists have used such a system in the past for tumor studies, nobody has ever answered, at the highest level of resolution offered by DNA sequencing, a whole genome comparison between the tumor from the human and the tumor once implanted into the HIM. Our choice to sequence the resected primary tumor xenograft also afforded a unique ability to compare this genome sequence to the primary tumor and to the metastatic tumor genomes.  Other inclusion and exclusion criteria included the following:  > Must have been newly diagnosed with clinical stage II or III breast cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy prior to surgery), over the age of 18, not pregnant, and willing and able to sign the consent form. Uncorrected coagulopathy, bleeding tendency or other conditions that might increase the risk of a biopsy procedure. Prior history of other invasive malignancies is not an exclusion criterion, unless the disease is active and progressing at the time of protocol screening.<p>  ::: :::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Breast Neoplasms ][1]    * [ Neoplasms ][2]    * [ Transplantation, Heterologous ][3]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68001943[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68009369[uid]     [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68014183[uid]  :::Study History   A previously healthy, premenopausal 44 year old African American woman presented to the medical oncologist with newly diagnosed inflammatory left breast cancer, clinical stage IIIB, T4dN1M0. Patient's past medical history was insignificant; no prior cancer, hypertension, heart disease or history of any surgical interventions. The patient's family history was obtained by the treating medical oncologist, and was positive for cancer in maternal grandfather with lung cancer, one uncle with throat cancer and another with brain cancer. All three were deceased.  Patient reported that she noted that left breast was larger than right. A mammogram performed 3 days later showed no significant masses, calcifications or other abnormalities. Patient subsequently presented to the surgeon following a 3 week history of an enlarging left breast mass with edema, erythema and increasing pain. A left breast excisional biopsy and skin biopsy were performed. Breast biopsy showed invasive ductal carcinoma, poorly differentiated, with extensive lymphatic invasion. The tumor was ER negative (0%), PR positive (11%) and HER2 negative (0) by immunohistochemistry. Skin biopsy showed invasive carcinoma involving deep dermal lymphatics.  Staging work-up was obtained prior to initiating neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Bone scan and CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis were negative for distant metastatic disease, positive only for left axillary lymphadenopathy.  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was enrolled in an institutional protocol studying the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on breast cancers, bone marrow cancer cells, and circulating cancer cells. Specimens of breast tumor mass, bone marrow and peripheral blood were collected and preserved prior to initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  The patient initiated neoadjuvant chemotherapy with four cycles of dose dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphomide followed by four cycles of paclitaxel. Left breast mastectomy with axillary node dissection performed 3 weeks following chemotherapy completion showed multifocal, poorly differentiated invasive mammary carcinoma with ductal and lobular features. Six of thirteen lymph nodes were positive. Pathologic stage was T2N2. Right breast simple mastectomy showed no evidence of malignancy. Post-treatment specimens of breast mass, bone marrow and peripheral blood were collected and preserved for the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy study at that time as well. Patient subsequently received four week course of radiation therapy to the left chest wall and regional lymphatics followed by tamoxifen 20 mg daily.  Despite these therapies, patient returned in approximately 11 months from diagnosis complaining of severe right hip pain, nausea and vomiting. Patient was found to have relapsed to the right cerebellum. Also of note: while never pathologically diagnosed, right hip pain was suspected to be due to progressive metastatic disease. Neurosurgical consultation was obtained, and patient was scheduled for sub-occipital craniectomy for resection of right cerebellar lesion. Prior to the procedure, informed consent was obtained for an institutional protocol entitled Longitudinal Cancer Genome Profiling Using Sequential Tissue Biopsies in Patients with Breast Cancer. After ensuring adequate tumor was obtained for diagnostic purposes, specimens from the cerebellar mass were collected and preserved for protocol. Pathology from craniectomy showed metastatic carcinoma, consistent with breast primary. Patient tolerated the procedure well. However, after the procedure, patient's neurologic status continued to decline and the patient expired 11 months after her initial diagnosis.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Richard Wilson, PhD.

Because diabetes is determined by both genetic and environmental factors, a better understanding of the etiology of diabetes requires a careful investigation of gene- environment interactions. The Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and Health Professionals' Follow-up Study (HPFS) are well-characterized cohort studies of women and men for whom stored blood and DNA samples are available as well as detailed information on dietary and lifestyle variables. The major goals of the project include: 1. To conduct a GWA analysis among 3,000 cases of T2D and 3,000 healthy controls in NHS/HPFS cohorts. 2. To use information on the joint effects of genes and a list of carefully selected environmental exposures at the initial screening stage to test gene-environment interactions. This approach optimizes our power to detect variants that have a sizeable marginal effect and those with a small marginal effect but a sizeable effect in a stratum defined by an environmental exposure. For this analysis, we have developed a joint test of genetic marginal effect and gene-environment interaction. This flexible two-degree-of-freedom test generally provides greater power than standard methods and has the potential to uncover both marginal genetic effects and stratum-specific effects.  The Version 1 (v1) dbGaP release of data from the GENEVA Diabetes Study (NHS/HPFS) includes data from the NHS only. The Version 2 (v2) dbGaP release includes data from both the NHS and HPFS.  This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [http://www.genevastudy.org][4]) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to type 2 diabetes mellitus through large-scale genome-wide association studies of well-characterized cohorts of nurses and health professionals. Genotyping was performed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, a GENEVA genotyping center. Data cleaning and harmonization were done at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.    * Study Weblinks: [Nurses' Health Study][5]; [Health Professionals Follow-up Study][6]    * Study Type: Nested Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 6033  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=NHGRI_DAC_Supplemental_Instruction.pdf     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000091.v2.p1     [3]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [4]: http://www.genevastudy.org     [5]: http://www.channing.harvard.edu/nhs/index.php     [6]: http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hpfs/  :::Nested Case-Control::: 6033:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to addiction through a large-scale genome-wide association study of DSM-IV alcohol dependent (and frequently illicit drug dependent) cases and non- dependent, unrelated control subjects of European and African American descent.  The focus of this proposal is a case-control design of unrelated individuals for a genetic association study of addiction. Cases are defined as individuals with DSM-IV alcohol dependence (lifetime) and potentially other illicit drug dependence. In addition to the categorical diagnosis, we have data on ordinal measurements of number of DSM-IV symptoms for alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, cocaine, opiates and other drugs so that we will able to construct quantitative measurements of addiction severity over a wide range of substances. Controls are defined as individuals who have been exposed to alcohol (and possibly to other drugs), but have never met lifetime diagnosis for alcohol dependence or dependence on other illicit substances. Analyses that include refinement of the phenotype and incorporation of important demographic and environmental factors into association studies will be pursued.  Cases and controls were selected from three large, complementary datasets: the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), the Family Study of Cocaine Dependence (FSCD), and the Collaborative Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence (COGEND).  **_COGA:_** COGA was initiated in 1989 and is a large-scale family study that has had as its primary aim the identification of genes that contribute to alcoholism susceptibility and related characteristics. COGA is funded through the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). Subjects were recruited from 7 sites across the U.S. Alcohol dependent probands were recruited from treatment facilities and assessed by personal interview. After securing permission, other family members were also assessed. A set of comparison families was drawn from the same communities as the families recruited through the alcohol dependent probands. Assessment involved a comprehensive personal interview developed for this project, the Semi- Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA), which gathers detailed information on alcoholism related symptoms along with other drugs and psychiatric symptoms. Families with three or more first-degree relatives who were alcohol dependent were invited for more extensive testing, including neurophysiology evaluations (ERPs and EEGs) and a battery of neuropsychological assessments. Blood was obtained for genetic studies. Institutional Review Boards at all sites approved the protocols, including sharing in the NIAAA national repository.  COGA has four Co-Principal Investigators Bernice Porjesz, Victor Hesselbrock, Howard Edenberg, and Laura Bierut. COGA includes nine different centers where data collection, analysis, and storage take place. The nine sites and Principal Investigators and Co-investigators are: University of Connecticut (Victor Hesselbrock); Indiana University (Howard Edenberg, John Nurnberger, Jr., Tatiana Foroud); University of Iowa (Samuel Kuperman); SUNY Downstate (Bernice Porjesz); Washington University in St. Louis (Laura Bierut, Alison Goate, John Rice); University of California at San Diego (Marc Schuckit); Howard University (Robert Taylor); Rutgers University (Jay Tischfield); Southwest Foundation (Laura Almasy). Q. Max Guo serves as the NIAAA Staff Collaborator. This national collaborative study is supported by the NIH Grant U10AA008401 from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).  **_Family Study of Cocaine Dependence (FSCD):_** This project was initiated in 2000 as a case-control family study of cocaine dependence funded through the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA; PI: Laura Bierut). The primary goal was to increase the understanding of the familial and non-familial antecedents and consequences of cocaine dependence. Cocaine dependent individuals were systematically recruited from chemical dependency treatment units (both public and private; residential and outpatient) in the greater St. Louis metropolitan area. Community based control subjects were identified through a Missouri Driver's License Registry (maintained at Washington University for research purposes) and matched by age, race, gender, and residential zip code. As a supplement to this project, blood samples were collected for future genetic analysis and were included in the NIDA Genetics Consortium. Phenotypic data, DNA, and cell lines are in the NIDA Center for Genetics Studies.  **_Collaborative Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence (COGEND):_** COGEND was initiated in 2001 as a three-part program project grant funded through the National Cancer Institute (NCI; PI: Laura Bierut). The three projects included a study of the familial transmission of nicotine dependence, a genetic study of nicotine dependence, and a study of the relationship of nicotine dependence with nicotine metabolism. The primary goal is to detect, localize, and characterize genes that predispose or protect an individual with respect to heavy tobacco consumption, nicotine dependence, and related phenotypes and to integrate these findings with the family transmission and nicotine metabolism findings. The primary design is a community based case-control family study. All subjects were recruited from Detroit and St. Louis. Nicotine dependent cases and non-dependent smoking controls were identified and recruited. In addition, one sibling for each case and control subject was recruited in a subset of the sample. Over 56,000 subjects aged 25-44 years were screened by telephone, over 3,100 subjects were personally interviewed, and over 2,900 donated blood samples for genetic studies.  All three studies (COGA, COGEND, FSCD) include measures of basic socio- demographic variables, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, family income, educational attainment, religious participation, and family structure. Other important covariates and/or potential moderators of genetic effects include comorbid addictions and age at initiation of use for cigarettes, alcohol and drugs. The assessments also include measures of various life stressors, such as physical and sexual abuse, which have been implicated in gene-environment interactions for several disorders. Coding for both individual variables and indices has been standardized across studies. All subjects were assessed in person by trained research assistants.  Funding support for genotyping, which was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR), was provided by the NIH GEI (U01HG004438), the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the NIH contract "High throughput genotyping for studying the genetic contributions to human disease"(HHSN268200782096C).  **Note for Publications Related to Study:** The Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE) has not yet generated publications. Below is a listing of publications related to the three studies from which the SAGE sample was selected. COGA has over 228 publications listed at [www.niaaagenetics.org][4]  This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [http://www.genevastudy.org][5]) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to addiction through a large-scale genome-wide association study of DSM-IV alcohol dependent (and frequently illicit drug dependent) cases and non-dependent, unrelated control subjects of European and African American descent. Genotyping was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR).

Cases met criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence and were preferentially selected from the proband group. If interviewed more than once, the subject had to be alcohol dependent on all interviews. Control subjects are individuals who have consumed alcohol, but never experienced any significant alcohol related problems. In addition, the control subjects did not meet any criteria for any illicit drug dependence (on any interview, if interviewed more than once).<p>  **_Family Study of Cocaine Dependence (FSCD)_**  >The sample consists of poly-substance dependent cases and controls. For this project, all cases met criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence (and because of the study design, most case subjects also met criteria for DSM-IV cocaine dependence). Controls are individuals from the same communities who have consumed alcohol, but have no lifetime history of dependence on any substance. A third group of subjects was defined as "other" if they were not alcohol dependent, but met lifetime diagnosis for DSM-IV marijuana dependence or dependence on another illicit drug.<p>  **_Collaborative Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence (COGEND)_**  >For this case control study of addiction, we selected cases as individuals who met criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence from either nicotine dependent cases or the non-dependent control subjects. Control subjects were selected from the non-dependent control population and had consumed alcohol, but did not meet criteria for alcohol, nicotine, or illicit drug dependence. A third group of subjects was defined as "other" if they were not alcohol dependent, but met lifetime diagnosis for DSM-IV marijuana dependence or dependence on another illicit drug.<p>  Permission to share data and samples was obtained from all subjects in the informed consent form. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects by trained research assistants. Prior to signing the consent form, a research assistant reviewed the form with the subject and answered any questions.  :::ILLUMINA_Human_1M:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Alcohol Dependence ][1]    * [ Nicotine Dependence ][2]    * [ Drug Dependence ][3]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68009271[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68014029[uid]     [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68019966[uid]  :::Study History   **_Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA)_**  >COGA was initiated in 1989, with Henri Begleiter as the Principal Investigator and Theodore Reich as the Co-Principal Investigator for 15 years. In 2004, while Henri Begleiter remained the PI, four Co-PIs were put into place: Howard Edenberg, Victor Hesselbrock, Bernice Porjesz and Laura Bierut. In 2006, the structure of the leadership changed again, with these four scientific Co-PIs leading the project, and Bernice Porjesz additionally serving as the Administrative PI. In addition to Henri Begleiter and Theodore Reich, several past key members of COGA were T.K. Li, Raymond Crowe, Wendy Reich, and C. Michael Conneally, who have moved on to new positions or have retired.<p>  In 1990, Phase I of COGA began, systematically ascertaining probands in treatment within six catchment areas, located across the United States (Indiana, New York, St. Louis, Connecticut, Iowa, San Diego). Probands met criteria for alcohol dependence based upon personal interview using the Semi- Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA), a polydiagnostic instrument developed by COGA. Probands also had to have at least two first- degree relatives available for evaluation. Over the next 5 years, affected probands and family members participated in the study. During this time, control families with the same family structure were also ascertained from the community, to be representative of the general population; controls did not have to be unaffected individuals. All families completed the same battery of tests. A subset of families underwent neurophysiological assessments.  In Phase II, between 1995 and 1999, some recruitment of new families continued, and the first follow-up protocol (5 year) was initiated. Affected families were extended. Adult clinical interviews conducted at this time used the SSAGA-II (a slight modification of the SSAGA to meet new diagnostic criteria).  Phase III began in 1999, and was primarily an extension of Phase II with an emphasis on recruiting high-risk families with young children. At this same time Howard University became an additional recruitment site.  In 2004, COGA began Phase IV, the prospective study of adolescents and young adults from pedigrees ascertained in Phases I-III, which is ongoing. Participants are reassessed every two years.

Laura Bierut was the Principal Investigator, and the study was funded by NIDA. The primary goal of this case-control study was to increase the understanding of the familial and non-familial antecedents and consequences of cocaine dependence. Subjects were systematically recruited from chemical dependency treatment units (both public and private; residential and outpatient) in the greater St. Louis metropolitan area to identify potential cocaine dependent individuals. Subjects were required to speak English and be over the age of 18 years. Subjects could not have a condition that prevented them from providing informed consent or effectively participating in the protocol (e.g., language difficulty, CNS damage, or extremely poor health).<p>  Community based control subjects were identified through a Missouri Driver's License Registry (maintained at Washington University for research purposes) and matched by age, race, gender, and residential zip code. Zip code matching was a proxy for socioeconomic and neighborhood matching. Control subjects were initially contacted with a recruitment letter briefly explaining the study and then screened by telephone call. During the phone call, the study was further described, and age, race, and gender were confirmed. If the community based comparison subject was dependent on any substance, a second comparison subject with no substance dependence was recruited. To screen for substance dependence, potential control subjects were asked about maximum number of drinks consumed in a 24-hour period, which correlates strongly with alcohol dependence. Control subjects were then recruited and thoroughly assessed to confirm a lifetime history of no dependence on any substance.  All subjects were assessed using the Semi-Structured Assessment for Cocaine Dependence (SSACD), a polydiagnostic instrument developed for this project and closely based on the SSAGA.  Data collection ended in 2005; data analysis is ongoing.

The primary design was a community based case- control family study.<p>  Nicotine dependent and control probands were recruited from the community using the Missouri Driver's License Registry in St. Louis and Health Maintenance Organization in Detroit. Nicotine dependent cases were identified during telephone screening as current smokers with a Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) score of 4 or more (maximum score of 10). Control subjects were identified during telephone screening as smokers (individuals who smoked at least 100 cigarettes lifetime), who never had any symptoms of dependence (lifetime FTND=0). All subjects had to be between the ages of 25 to 44 years and speak English. Subjects could not have a condition that prevented them from providing informed consent or effectively participating in the protocol (e.g., language difficulty, CNS damage, or extremely poor health). In a subset of the sample, one sibling was also recruited for case and control subjects.  All subjects were assessed using the Semi-Structured Assessment of Nicotine Dependence (SSAND), which was developed specifically for COGEND and is modeled after the SSAGA and Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).

phs000335.v2.p2::: Genome-Wide associations of Lung Health Study (LHS):::Study Description   The 'Genome-Wide Associations Environmental Interactions in the Lung Health Study' at Johns Hopkins University aims to test for association between lung function decline as a primary outcome associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using banked DNA and phenotype data on 4,287 European Americans from the longitudinal, multicenter Lung Health Study (LHS). The broad goals of the LungGO/ESP-GO falls into two general categories: (i) discovery of all variants (i.e., common and rare) in all protein-coding regions of the human genome (i.e., the exome) conferring risk to complex pulmonary diseases including COPD, in a subset of the LHS cohort. The Johns Hopkins University LHS cohort offers a unique opportunity to elucidate genetic variants that cause COPD.  The Lung Health Study I was a randomized multicenter clinical trial with 5887 participants carried out from October 1986 to April 1994, designed to test the effectiveness of smoking cessation and bronchodilator administration in smokers aged 35 to 60 with mild lung function impairment. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups:    * usual care, who received no intervention    * smoking intervention with the inhaled bronchodilator ipratroprium bromide    * smoking intervention with an inhaled placebo.  The effect of intervention was evaluated by the rate of decline of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).  For the GWAS, only the subset of European American LHS participants for whom lung function data from three time points or more are available. Thus, the GWAS represents 73% of the 5,887 volunteers who participated in the LHS study. Importantly, LHS subjects included had similar demographics (including age, gender and BMI) and rates of lung function decline (mean annual change in FEV1% predicted: -0.96 %/yr vs. -0.99 %/yr, p=0.57) compared with those not included in the GWAS, reflecting little selection bias for our primary outcome. They were, however, more likely to have quit smoking after 5 years.  This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [http://www.genevastudy.org][1]) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to lung function through large-scale genome-wide association studies of smokers enrolled in a multicenter clinical trial. Genotyping was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). Data cleaning and harmonization were done at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.    * Study Weblink: [Lung Health Study][2]    * Study Types: Longitudinal, Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 4391  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.genevastudy.org     [2]: http://www.biostat.umn.edu/lhs/  :::Longitudinal, Cohort::: 4391:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Gender will be identified on the data in this initiative, but will not be an eligibility criteria. The contributing LHS protocols did not exclude subjects from any racial or ethnic background; however, only European Americans are included in this dataset. Children were excluded from the Lung Health Studies because the purpose of LHS was to test the efficacy of interventions for airway obstruction in adult smokers.  :::Human660W-Quad_v1_A:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive ][1]    * [ COPD ][1]    * [ Smoking Cessation ][2]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68029424[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68016540[uid]  :::Study History   LHS was a multicenter (10 centers) in the US and Canada. Each center recruited 500-669 participants. Although enrollment into the LHS was open to participants regardless of ethnicity, only 4% of volunteers were non-white, and of those, only 225 were African American. The initial study population consisted of 5,887 men and women (63% male) who were smokers (aged 35-60) with spirometric evidence of mild to moderate lung function impairment. For the GWAS, only the subset of European American LHS participants for whom lung function data from three timepoints or more are available. Thus, the GWAS represents 73% of the 5,887 volunteers who participated in the LHS study. Importantly, LHS subjects included had similar demographics (including age, gender and BMI) and rates of lung function decline (mean annual change in FEV1% predicted: -0.96 %/yr vs. -0.99 %/yr, p=0.57) compared with those not included in the GWAS, reflecting little selection bias for our primary outcome. They were, however, more likely to have quit smoking after 5 years.  Participants were randomized with equal probability into three groups: (i) smoking intervention plus bronchodilator (ipratropium bromide); (ii) smoking intervention plus placebo; or (iii) no intervention. The primary outcome was rate of change and cumulative change in FEV1 over a 5 year period. Participants in the LHS were categorized as 'continuous smokers' or 'sustained quitters'. 'Intermittent smokers' (those quit at some annual visits but not at all) will be excluded from this analysis. Continuous smokers (N=2,231) were individuals who reported smoking at each annual visit. Sustained quitters (N=801) were those participants who had self-report of non-smoking (< 1 cigarette per week) which was validated with salivary cotinine assay and exhaled CO measurement as abstinent at every annual visit. The primary finding was that the use of the bronchodilator did not influence the long-term decline in FEV1. However, the aggressive smoking intervention programme significantly reduced the age-related decline in FEV1.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Kathleen Barnes, PhD.

EGAS00000000056::: Identification of cis- and trans-regulatory variation modulating microRNA expression levels in human fibroblasts:::Study Description       MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory noncoding RNAs that affect the production of a significant fraction of human mRNAs via post-transcriptional regulation. Interindividual variation of the miRNA expression levels is likely to influence the expression of miRNA target genes and may therefore contribute to phenotypic differences in humans, including susceptibility to common disorders. The extent to which miRNA levels are genetically controlled is largely unknown. In this report, we assayed the expression levels of miRNAs in primary fibroblasts from 180 European newborns of the GenCord project and performed association analysis to identify eQTLs (expression quantitative traits loci). We detected robust expression for 121 miRNAs out of 365 interrogated. We have identified significant cis- (10%) and trans- (11%) eQTLs. Furthermore, we detected one genomic locus (rs1522653) that influences the expression levels of five miRNAs, thus unraveling a novel mechanism for coregulation of miRNA expression    * Study Weblink: [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000056][1]    * Study Type: Population    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access:  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000056  :::Population:::0::: ::: ::: ::: ::: :::

The collection was done in 4 separate groups from 1984-2001 (S1-S4). One of the KORA groups, S3/F3, will be utilized for our GWAS because it is the only group with refractive error (RE) measurements. Consequent to informed consent, each of the surveys sampled subjects from ten strata according to age (range 25-74 years) and sex (equal ratio) with a minimum stratum size of > 400 subjects. In the KORA S3 study 4,856 subjects were studied between 1994 and 1995, and 3,006 individuals from S3 returned for follow up between 2003 and 2005 (S3/F3). For this refractive error study, we are including 1,981 subjects from S3/F3 (mean age 55.7, range 35-84). For each subject, eyeglass prescriptions were measured in addition to an evaluation by the Nikon Retinomax. Subjects with predisposing medical conditions, i.e., connective tissue disorders, and ocular conditions i.e., cataract and corneal opacities, that might predispose them to refractive error will not be included for genotyping.  Whole genome association genotyping will be performed to determine common alleles that contribute to the variation of the quantitative trait of refractive error.    * Study Type: Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1980  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Cohort::: 1980:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000224.v1.p1::: VitGene Generalized Vitiligo Genetics Study:::Study Description   Generalized vitiligo is an autoimmune disease in which melanocyte loss results in patchy depigmentation of skin and hair. For this GWAS of generalized vitiligo, 579,146 SNPs were genotyped in 1514 generalized vitiligo cases of European-derived white (CEU) ancestry versus data from 2813 "public" CEU controls. 49 strongly associated SNPs from the first phase of the GWAS were then tested in two replication studies, one comparing 677 independent cases and 1106 CEU controls, and the other a family-based analysis of 204 CEU simplex generalized vitiligo trios and 310 CEU multiplex families. Overall, significant association of generalized vitiligo was detected for SNPs in several genes previously associated with other autoimmune diseases, including MHC class I (P = 9.05 x 10-23) and class II (P = 4.50 x 10-34) loci, PTPN22 (P = 1.31 x 10-7), LPP (P = 1.01 x 10-11), IL2RA (P = 2.78 x 10-9), UBASH3A (P = 1.26 x 10-9), and C1QTNF6 (P = 2.21 x 10-16). Association was also detected for SNPs in two novel immune-related loci, RERE (P = 7.07 x 10-15), GZMB (P = 3.44 x 10-8), and in a locus that may mediate melanocyte target cell specificity, TYR (P = 1.60 x 10-18) encoding tyrosinase. These findings thus demonstrate association between generalized vitiligo and multiple genes, some associated with other autoimmune diseases and others that may mediate target- cell specificity, and suggest a possible inverse relationship between susceptibility to vitiligo versus melanoma.    * Study Types: Case-Control, Parent-Offspring Trios, Multiplex Families    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1392  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control, Parent-Offspring Trios, Multiplex Families::: 1392:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000187.v1.p1::: High Density SNP Association Analysis of Melanoma: Case-Control and Outcomes Investigation:::Study Description   This research builds upon an extensive resource of melanoma cases and hospital based controls collected over several years at the U.T. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The goal of this research is to identify novel susceptibility and outcome-related genes for melanoma using a systematic genome-wide association- based approach. Our goal is to conduct high-density SNP association and outcome studies. This dbGaP study contains samples from 2000 European ancestry cases and 1000 European ancestry controls using the Illumina OMNI1-Quad SNP chip. As a part of an ongoing R01 project, we have epidemiological data together with candidate gene results for 1000 of the melanoma cases and the controls. With regard to the outcome aspect of our design, as part of our melanoma Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) grant, our MelCore database contains comprehensive, prospectively maintained clinical information from all melanoma patients included in the study cohort, including primary tumor histopathology and staging information, standard and investigational blood tumor markers, details of surgical and systemic therapies, and extensive follow-up information, including time to relapse or recurrence, pattern of recurrence and survival duration. Finally, we intend to collaborate with the GenoMEL collaboration so we can jointly evaluate each other's findings. The goal of our analysis will be to identify novel genetic factors predisposing the development of melanoma, as well as genetic factors controlling melanoma stage at presentation, recurrence and progression.  This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [http://www.genevastudy.org][1]) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to melanoma through large-scale genome- wide association studies of 2000 European ancestry cases and 1000 European ancestry controls. Genotyping was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). Data cleaning and harmonization were done at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.    * Study Types: Case-Control, Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 3115  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.genevastudy.org  :::Case-Control, Case Set::: 3115:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Tables 1 and 2 provide demographic data on cases seen at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center for whom the SPORE or Dr. Wei's grant have collected both DNA samples and data. There is currently a total of 2159 melanoma cancer cases with DNA available using samples from both Dr. Wei's and the melanoma SPORE and both projects are continuing to accrue subjects. The mean and median age at diagnosis for cases in the combined melamoma R01/SPORE was 50.9, which is about 6 years younger than the mean age of 57 reported by SEER ([Lachiewicz et al., 2008][1]). Among the R01/SPORE patients, the median primary Breslow tumor thickness was 1.1 mm (range 0.1-99) and 15% of patients had ulcerated primary tumors. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 98% of patients presenting with localized melanoma; of these, 20.3% had positive sentinel lymph nodes. The patients in the combined R01/SPORE dataset have a median follow-up of 35 months (mean 36); 346 (19%) have developed a melanoma recurrence and 193 (11%) have died. 2.8% of patients have had more than one primary melanoma and 2.6% presented with unknown primary melanoma. Sample acquisition has been a major focus for the SPORE and the melanoma program, in general. There are currently 6699 Paraffin- embedded blocks, 2878 snap-frozen samples, 3200 OCT-preserved samples (that can be used for RNA studies) and 83 new melanoma tumor lines. These samples can be used for follow-up and correlative analyses for loci that are identified. Data are maintained in the MelCore database which was established in part through an institutional grant and maintains information on 8976 patients.  **Table 1: **Staging information  Staging Frequency Percent  AMP Only  2  0.11  I  970  53.98  I/II  153  8.51  II  295  16.42  III  343  19.09  IV  19  1.06  In-Situ  15  0.83  Unknown  360  **Table 2: **Ethnicity of cases  RACE  RACE Frequency Percent  White  2109  97.7  Hispanic  37  1.7  Asian  3  0.1  Black  9  0.5  Unknown  1  0.0  Total  2159  100  For the R01 population that has been assembled by Dr. Wei, the mean age at onset is 52 years of age. Of those meeting criteria and consenting to the study, 99% are non-Hispanic. Tables 1 and 2 of the manuscript of Li et al. (2007) contains detailed information about the melanoma risk factors that have been identified in the R01 population for the cases and controls that will be genotyped. Of individuals studied, 64% of the cases are male and 67% of the controls are male and 20% of cases and 18% of controls show household incomes of $35,000 or less. Cases and controls were well matched with respect to demographic factors. Risk factors for melanoma included blond or red hair (OR=2.15), Blue eye color (OR=2.09), moderate or poor skin tanning (OR=1.9), lifetime sun burning (OR=1.55), atypical nevi (OR=7.78), frecking as a child (OR=1.55), and having a first degree relative with cancer (OR=1.42). In tables 1 and 2 above, 360 cases that were accrued by Dr. Wei do not have staging information yet retrieved as they were accrued before the SPORE/Melcore database was established, but these data will be retrieved from the medical charts. R01 cases and controls respond to a detailed questionnaire about their sun exposure patterns, skin type, hair color, history of moles, family history of cancers and SES.

phs000217.v1.p1::: Genome-wide association study of leprosy in Chinese population:::Study Description   Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by _Mycobacterium leprae_ (_M. leprae_). Due to _M. leprae's_ narrow host range and an inability to be cultured _in vitro_, the biological investigation of this disease has been difficult. Host genetic factors have been suggested to play an important role in disease development, but few have been identified.  In this study, we attempted to identify the host genetic factors by performing a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in Chinese population. The initial genome-wide scan was done by genotyping 706 patients and 1225 controls using the Illumina HumanHap610 BeadChip, and the follow-up study was performed by genotyping 93 SNPs in three independent samples consisting of 3254 cases and 5955 controls. We identified significant association (P<10-10) within six genes CCDC122 (13q14), C13orf31 (13q14), NOD2 (16q12), TNFSF15 (9q32), HLA-DR (6p21) and RIPK2 (8q21), and suggestive association (P=5.68x10-6) within LRRK2 (12q12). We also revealed suggestive evidence for C13orf31, LRRK2, NOD2 and RIPK2 to show stronger association in the multibacillary form than the paucibacillary form of leprosy. Our findings highlight the importance of the innate immune response, particularly NOD2-mediated signaling, in leprosy and suggests a new therapeutic target for leprosy.  Here, the summary statistics from the initial genome-wide association analysis were reported.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1220  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 1220:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

All the subjects were recruited from Central China (Anhui, Shandong and Jiangsu provinces) in 2005 to 2008. The diagnosis of leprosy was based on medical records stored in local leprosy control institutions and clinical assessments at the time of blood taken (looking for evidence of leprosy such as claw hand, lagophthalmos or foot drop, etc). The controls were healthy individuals without leprosy, autoimmune and systemic disorders and family history of leprosy (including first-, second- and third-degree relatives). Demographic characteristics were also collected. All the cases and controls were recruited using the uniform criteria and matched regarding to ethnic origin and geographic area. The ethnicity of all the subjects was determined based on self-reported ancestry. All the subjects were recruited with written informed consent, and the study was approved by the institutional IRB committees at the Shandong Provincial Institute of Dermatology and Venereology, Shandong Academy of Medical Science and the Anhui Medical University.  :::Human610_Quadv1_B:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Leprosy ][1]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68007918[uid]  ::: :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigators **      * Fu-Ren Zhang, PhD.

phs000140.v1.p1::: A Whole Genome Association Search for Type 2 Diabetes Genes in African Americans:::Study Description   Over 2.8 million African Americans have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This represents approximately 13% of the African American population and a significant proportion of the 21 million Americans living with diabetes. On average, an African American individual is twice as likely to have T2DM as a European American peer. Our research group has been actively involved in the study of African American diabetes genetics for over 15 years. We hypothesize that genes contributing to the development of T2DM in African Americans exist and can be located using modern molecular genetic methods. With the exception of TCF7L2(Transcription factor 7-like 2) evidence to date suggests variants that contribute T2DM risk in European-derived populations are not significant contributors to African American T2DM risk. We have performed a SNP-based Whole Genome Association (WGA) analysis on the Affymetrix 6.0 in a case control population of over 1000 African American T2DM cases and over 1000 non- diabetic controls. The DNAs have been collected from participants using uniform criteria from North Carolina and neighboring states. Genotype data will be subjected to extensive genetic analysis with the goal of defining a priority list of SNPs for genotyping in independent populations for confirmation and further detailed analysis.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 2004  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 2004:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000140  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   **Cases**: For this study we propose to focus on the unrelated cases and controls in our collection. Consenting self-identified African Americans, age 35 or older, born in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, or Tennessee, were eligible for participation. Recruiting was performed at clinical facilities, health fairs, church participation, and through public advertising using a uniform ascertainment. T2DM was diagnosed in patients who received oral hypoglycemic agents or dietary therapy without insulin for at least one year after initial diagnosis and in whom initial diagnosis of diabetes mellitus occurred after age 35. Patients with a history of diabetic ketoacidosis or who developed diabetes mellitus prior to age 25 and received continuous insulin therapy since diagnosis, were presumed to have type 1 diabetes and were ineligible. For the 1000 cases proposed for the WGA analysis, we wish to use DNAs from cases with T2DM and DM-ESRD (Diabetes Mellitus - End Stage Renal Disease), which make up a majority of our collection. The great advantage of this approach is that these cases are clearly long term diabetes affected individuals and with the WGA of T2DM we will also get a WGA of DM-ESRD. Importantly, as outlined below, we have the capability to differentiate between genes which contribute solely to T2DM and solely DM-ESRD through our other collections and collaborations. There is no extant literature that suggests that there are any population-based differences between subjects with T2DM (without ESRD) and subjects with T2DM and DM-ESRD. If there are unperceived differences we would note that subjects with DM-ESRD has one of the most devastating complications of diabetes and are thus of high importance to study.  **Controls**: Control samples have been recruited from health fairs, church participation, and public advertising. The great majority of the control subjects have fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measures and renal function analysis and are designated (diabetes) controls if they have FPG  100 mg/dL consistent with current American Diabetes Association (ADA) definition and no evidence of microalbuminuria. It is noteworthy that the mean BMI of cases and controls are similar and that the mean age of examination for the controls is 8.7 years later than the mean age of diagnosis for the cases.  **Exclusions**: Inability to provide informed consent.  :::AFFY_6.0:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 ][1]    * [ Diabetic Nephropathies ][2]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68003924[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68003928[uid]  :::Study History   The development of this study reflects a 15 year commitment to the study of the genetics of type 2 diabetes and complications of diabetes in the African American population.

phs000196.v2.p1::: Genome-Wide Association Study of Parkinson Disease: Genes and Environment:::Study Description   This is a gene-environment study of Parkinson's disease. PD is a common, progressive, age-related, movement disorder that affects 1-2% of the people over the age of 65. The NeuroGenetics Research Consortium (NGRC) is the infrastructure of the study. Protocols and methods are standardized across NGRC clinics and labs as much as possible. The 2000 patients and 2000 control subjects selected for this GWAS were recruited at the NGRC-affiliated movement disorder clinics in Oregon, Washington, Georgia and New York. All 4000 subjects were white and all DNA samples were extracted from whole blood and unamplified. Seventy-five percent of subjects have data on cigarette smoking and caffeinated coffee consumption, which are inversely associated with PD risk. This study population represents the norm for clinical genetic studies of PD; i.e., NGRC estimates of risk to relatives, heritability, genotype frequencies, and exposure frequencies (see references) are very close to estimates from meta-analyses.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 4011  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 4011:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000497.v1.p1::: Genetic analysis of Hirschsprung disease:::Study Description   Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a birth defect resulting from the absence of nerve (ganglion) cells in the gastrointestinal tract. Hirschsprung disease has a population incidence of 1/5,000 live births and most often occurs as an isolated condition. However, approximately 30% of HSCR cases are associated with other birth defects such as Down syndrome, deafness, hypopigmentation, and Congenital Central Hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). Hirschsprung disease is a genetic condition with autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and multigenic patterns of inheritance described. The goal of the research study is to identify genes harboring causative HSCR mutations and to better understand the complex inheritance of HSCR in families using whole genome mapping and sequencing studies with functional follow-up of candidate genes and variants. We intend to ascertain the frequency with which mutations in any human gene lead to familial and isolated forms of HSCR. Clinical information is collected to allow investigation of possible genotype - phenotype correlations.  The subject population consists of individuals diagnosed with HSCR and their unaffected relatives. Individuals/families are ascertained through support groups, web-based listings of research studies and genetic testing services, an educational study website, and referrals from genetic counselors and physicians. Blood, or tissue, samples are requested from affected individuals and their unaffected relatives.    * Study Weblink: [Hirschsprung Disease Study][1]    * Study Types: Probands, Mendelian, Family    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 276  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://aravindachakravartilab.org/pro/Hirschsprung_Study.html  :::Probands, Mendelian, Family::: 276:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000388.v1.p1::: Charles R. Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine (IPM) BioBank Genome Wide Association Study of Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolic Phenotypes:::Study Description   ** Important Links and Information **    * [Data Use Certification Agreement][1]    * [Apply for Authorized Access ][2]    * [Acknowledgement Statements][3]  The Institute for Personalized Medicine (IPM) Biobank Project is a consented, EMR-linked medical care setting biorepository of the Mount Sinai Medical Center (MSMC) drawing from a population of over 70,000 inpatients and 800,000 outpatient visits annually. MSMC serves diverse local communities of upper Manhattan, including Central Harlem (86% African American), East Harlem (88% Hispanic Latino), and Upper East Side (88% Caucasian/white) with broad health disparities. IPM Biobank populations include 28% African American (AA), 38% Hispanic Latino (HL) predominantly of Caribbean origin, 23% Caucasian/White (CW). IPM Biobank disease burden is reflective of health disparities with broad public health impact: average body mass index of 28.9 and frequencies of hypertension (55%), hypercholesterolemia (32%), diabetes (30%), coronary artery disease (25%), chronic kidney disease (23%), among others. Biobank operations are fully integrated in clinical care processes, including direct recruitment from clinical sites, waiting areas and phlebotomy stations by dedicated Biobank recruiters independent of clinical care providers, prior to or following a clinician standard of care visit. Recruitment currently occurs at a broad spectrum of over 30 clinical care sites.  Minorities are strikingly underrepresented in GWAS, including Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and Chronic Kidney Disease; multigenic genetic risk scores for CAD have been recently validated in European ancestry populations, but not in AA or HL populations. Several important opportunities exist for extending additional GWAS to minority populations with a shared risk spectrum of CAD and CKD. For example, progressive CKD is a major and independent risk factor for CVD with an inverse relationship between estimated GFR (eGFR), and risk for mortality and cardiovascular events. This increased risk is only partially explained by the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors among these patients.  We conducted a GWAS of CAD and CKD related phenotypes in IPM Biobank with the primary objective to explore the genetics of overlapping CAD and CKD predominantly in minority populations characterized by increased risk.    * Study Weblink: [eMERGE][4]    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 2867  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000388.v1.p1     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [3]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=eMERGE_Acknowledgement.pdf     [4]: https://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/victr/dcc/projects/acc/index.php/About  :::Case-Control::: 2867:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000391.v1.p1::: Determining Genetic Role in Treatment Response to Anti-Platelet Interventions (The PAPI Study):::Study Description   CHD is the leading cause of death in the United States. One of the most common ways to prevent CHD is to take an anti-platelet agent, which lessens platelet aggregation. Two of the most common anti-platelet agents are aspirin and clopidogrel. However, up to 25% to 30% of people do not respond to these medications. Evidence indicates that treatment response may be related to genetics. The purpose of this study is to determine specific gene variants that predict response to aspirin and clopidogrel therapy.  This study is part of a larger group of studies called the Pharmacogenomics Research Network (PGRN). Participants are from the Old Order Amish of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. They are well suited for genetic studies because they are a homogenous, closed, founder population. Participants received 300 mg of clopidogrel on the first day, then 75 mg of clopidogrel per day for the next 6 days. On the last day of clopidogrel treatment, participants took a single dose of 324 mg aspirin. Participants underwent platelet function tests before and after clopidogrel alone, and then again after taking clopidogrel plus aspirin. Using the gene variation profiles across the genome, researchers analyzed which variants correspond to treatment response.    * Study Weblink: [PAPI][1]    * Study Type: Interventional    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 666  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://medschool.umaryland.edu/Departments/Department-of-Medicine /Division-of-Endocrinology,-Diabetes-and-Nutrition/Amish-Studies /Pharmacogenomics-of-Anti-Platelet-Intervention-%28PAPI%29.asp  :::Interventional::: 666:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000203.v1.p1::: A Genome-Wide Association Study of Peripheral Arterial Disease:::Study Description   ** Important Links and Information **    * [Instructions][1] to request Authorized Access    * [Data Use Certification Agreement][2]    * [Apply for Authorized Access ][3]    * [Acknowledgement Statements][4]  The Electronic Medical Record Phenotypes and Community-engaged Genomic Association Study aims to identify genetic variants mediating susceptibility to peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The study leverages a biorepository of blood samples of 1688 PAD cases and 1649 controls, and the electronic medical record (EMR) to annotate the biorepository. PAD cases were identified from the vascular laboratory database as having an ankle brachial index (ABI) <0.9 at rest or after exercise or having non-compressible vessels. Controls were without prior history of atherosclerotic vascular disease and when tested, no evidence of ischemia on a stress test. Phenotypes and environmental exposures including age, ethnicity, demographic and anthropometric data are derived from the Mayo Electronic Medical Record (EMR). Comorbidities were determined using algorithms for diabetes and hypertension based on ICD-9 codes and medication use. Relevant laboratory data, including lipid levels, fasting blood sugar and serum creatinine at index date or within a 1-year window of the index date were extracted. Medication classes at index date were identified using Mayo's Natural Language Processing-based system with RxNorm codification and NDF-RT terminologies mapping. Smoking status was confirmed by natural language processing of clinical notes. Genotyping of ~600,000 SNPs across the genome is being conducted at the Broad Institute using the Illumina 660W platform. Statistical analyses will be conducted to identify genetic variants associated with susceptibility to PAD.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 3337  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=NHGRI_DAC_Supplemental_Instruction.pdf     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000203.v1.p1     [3]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [4]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=eMERGE_Acknowledgement.pdf  :::Case-Control::: 3337:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Patients seen at Mayo Clinic who are suspected of having PAD/claudication are referred for lower extremity non-invasive arterial evaluation at this laboratory. We used the following criteria to define presence of PAD: 1) an ankle brachial index of <0.9 at rest or 1 min after exercise on the treadmill, along with an abnormal continuous wave Doppler signal in one of the lower extremity arteries, or 2) presence of non-compressible vessels. We excluded patients with PAD secondary to vasculitis, radiation to the abdomen or lower extremities, trauma to lower extremity artery, thrombophilia and in situ thrombosis formation, and end- stage renal disease.  **Control subjects.** Controls subjects were identified from patients referred to the Cardiovascular Health Clinic for screening for cardiovascular disease. A large proportion of these patients underwent stress exercise ECG to rule out coronary artery disease. We excluded patients who had a positive stress ECG, those who were younger than age 50, or those who had history of prior coronary heart disease. A proportion of the subjects who underwent exercise ECG also underwent measurement of ankle brachial index. The prevalence of an abnormal ABI in patients who had a negative stress ECG was <1%.  :::Human660W-Quad_v1_A:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Peripheral Vascular Diseases ][1]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68016491[uid]  :::Study History   _Motivation for the study:_ Sequencing of the human genome, subsequent validation of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and advances in genotyping technology with decreasing costs have made possible studies that involve genotyping of 500,000 or more SNPs across the genome (genome-wide association studies). Combining genome-wide association data with clinical information from the electronic medical record (EMR) provides new opportunities to identify genetic variants that influence susceptibility to the common 'complex' diseases that afflict humans; this knowledge can be used to improve diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, and treatment of these diseases. Existing health care systems can be leveraged for genomic research given the potential for speed, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and rapid translation to improved care of patients. However, optimal approaches for conducting genome- wide research in biorepositories to identify genes that influence susceptibility to complex diseases have yet to be established.  An important goal of the project is to delineate optimal strategies for extracting comprehensive and unbiased phenotype/exposure data from the Mayo EMR, obtaining suitable consent for genome-wide association studies and broad data sharing, and interacting with participants, communities, and IRBs. We will attempt to define potential sources of bias and error in phenotypic and exposure data derived from EMR, and identify approaches for improving data collection and standardization for genomic research. Additionally, we will identify sources of concern among biorepository participants and other relevant groups regarding current consent and consultation processes for application of genome-wide technologies, and for sharing of data; define needs for additional consent and/or consultation, and recommend approaches for improving consent and consultation processes in biorepository-based research. Using state of the art statistical genetic methods, we will identify genetic variants associated with two distinct phenotypes of PAD using phenotype and covariate information derived from EMR data. We will make the resulting data rapidly and widely available for research use and work collaboratively to share experience and expertise across participating biorepositories.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Christopher G.

phs000308.v1.p1::: The Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Genes and Environment (GLAUGEN) Study:::Study Description   ** Important Links and Information **    * [Instructions][1] to request Authorized Access    * [Data Use Certification Agreement][2]    * [Apply for Authorized Access ][3]  **Background Information:** Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an age- related, intraocular pressure (IOP)-dependent progressive optic neuropathy that ultimately leads to irreversible blindness. Vision loss from POAG is a condition of public health significance. Current evidence suggests that POAG is a polygenetic disease modified by environmental influences. Despite the fact that a positive family history of disease is an important risk factor for POAG, conventional linkage and candidate gene approaches have revealed less than 5% of the genetic component of the disease. Furthermore, there is no consensus on environment risk factors for POAG. Elevated IOP is the only modifiable risk factor for POAG; yet, lowering IOP slows, but does not halt the disease process.  **Study Objectives:** The overall goal of our research is to elucidate the pathogenesis of POAG so that cost-effective disease detection and primary prevention strategies can be implemented. The primary aim of the **Glau**coma **G**ene **En**vironment Initiative (GLAUGEN), funded by the Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), is to discover genetic loci associated with POAG. The secondary aim of GLAUGEN, funded by NHGRI and the National Eye Institute, is to discover gene environment interactions in POAG.  **Methods and study populations:** For this study, we have assembled cases and controls from three studies: the Nurses' Health Study (**NHS**), the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (**HPFS**) and the Genetic Etiologies of POAG (**GEP**) project based at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI). This case-control group includes 1057 unrelated cases and 1272 controls. Members of the NHS and HPFS also have repeated environmental exposure data collected prior to a diagnosis of POAG.  NHS - The Nurses Health Study started in 1976 under the direction of Dr. Frank E. Speizer. With funding from the NIH, registered nurses from 11 US states were invited to complete a detailed questionnaire regarding lifestyle and health biennially. Initially, 121,000 women responded to the baseline questionnaire. Currently, Dr. Susan Hankinson serves as the program director for the NHS.  HPFS - The Health Professionals Follow-up Study began in 1986 under the direction of Drs. Walter Willett and Meir Stampfer. Under the auspices of the NIH, they enlisted 51,529 male health professionals from throughout the US to complete similarly designed biennial questionnaires.  Beginning in 1990, questions regarding ocular health were added to biennial questionaires completed by health professionals participating in the NHS and HPFS. This allowed us to formulate (PI: S. Hankinson; NEI) and maintain (PI: L. Pasquale; NEI) a cohort at risk for POAG derived from the respective general cohorts who were under ophthalmic care. We then developed a definition of POAG that allowed us to identify cases from a population that was geographically dispersed. The centerpiece of this definition is the presence of reproducible visual field loss consistent with nerve fiber layer (NFL) dropout (the NFL contains the axons that comprise the optic nerve) on reliable tests. Reproducible visual field loss occurred in the context of anterior segment findings that did not suggest a secondary cause of elevated IOP and posterior segment findings that did not suggest a secondary cause of visual field loss. We selected controls from the cohort at risk for POAG on the basis of age, gender and time period when cases were identified.  GEP - The Genetic Etiologies of POAG was initiated in 1996 with funding from the National Eye Institute under the direction of Dr. Janey Wiggs. The purpose of this work was to discover novel genetic loci associated with POAG. In the GEP, cases were derived predominantly from the Glaucoma Service at MEEI. The majority of cases had an examination by a glaucoma specialist and met the definition for POAG used in NHS and HPFS. Cases with only one reliable visual field consistent with NFL dropout were included if there was a cup-disc ratio of 0.7 or more. The majority of controls were patients who presented to the MEEI comprehensive ophthalmology service for routine eye examination or from spouses of MEEI patients with secondary forms of glaucoma. Other controls were identified from regional glaucoma screenings held throughout Massachusetts. Members of GEP have detailed ocular phenotype data but limited information on environmental exposures.  This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [http://www.genevastudy.org][4]) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to primary open-angle glaucoma through large-scale genome-wide association studies of three well-characterized cohorts of cases and controls, some in matched pairs. Genotyping was performed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, a GENEVA genotyping center. Data cleaning and harmonization were performed at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 2289  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=NHGRI_DAC_Supplemental_Instruction.pdf     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000308.v1.p1     [3]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [4]: http://www.genevastudy.org  :::Case-Control::: 2289:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Age  40 years old.    2. European-derived Caucasian or Hispanic Caucasian.    3. Slit lamp exam findings did not reveal secondary causes for elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Specifically cases showed no signs of exfoliation syndrome, pigment dispersion syndrome, uveitis or trauma on slit lamp examination when the diagnosis of POAG was made. Subsequent discovery of these signs after a diagnosis of POAG was made does not exclude a subject.    4. For cases, the filtration apparatus was open to the filtering portion of the trabecular meshwork for at least 180 degrees. Alternatively, there was evidence that the pupils were pharmacologically dilated without an elevation of IOP.    5. There was visual field (VF) loss (on reliable VFs) consistent with nerve fiber layer loss. A reliable and abnormal VF consistent with glaucoma was defined according tothe following considerations:      1. A reliable visual field was defined by fixation loss  33%, false positive rate  20% and false negative rate  20%.      2. For automated perimetry there was no requirement for the type of perimeter used except that the perimeter must have an age-matched controlled database that allows for the equivalent of a total deviation and pattern deviation plot. Thus Dicon and Octopus perimetry data were acceptable.      3. Goldmann visual fields (GVFs) were acceptable unless the perimetrist regarded the test as unreliable.      4. The VF defect must be regarded as consistent with nerve fiber layer loss (loss not consistent with choroidal-retinal pathology, chiasmal disease or post-chiasmal lesions).      5. The VFs were graded in a standardized manner using the pattern deviation plot.      6. For automated VFs, the pattern deviation plot or its equivalent was stratified into superior and inferior paracentral, nasal step, Bjerrum area and temporal wedge regions. A cluster of 3 or more point that were -5dB reduced from normal constitute the minimal change consistent with nerve fiber layer pathology. In the superior Bjerrum area, the superior-most points were disregarded because they could be influenced by the lid position. Each VF was graded on a Glaucoma VF Review Sheet.      7. The VF loss was not explained by choroidal-retinal disease mimicking nerve fiber layer loss (such as retinitis pigmentosa) or other optic nerve disease (such as optic nerve drusen or ischemic optic neuropathy).      8. For GVFs, the investigator stratified the field into similar regions to assess whether the VF contained defects consistent with NFL loss.      9. If the patient had other reasons to have VF loss, such as a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), then only the segment of the pattern deviation plot that was not affected by the CVA was used to determine whether the participant met criterion for a case.    6. The VF loss was reproduced on a subsequent reliable VF in the same region. For example, if the 1st VF shows a superior nasal step, then the subsequent VF must also showed a superior nasal step. In the GEP, in lieu of a subsequent VF, the cup to dic ratio (CDR) could be used for confirmation if the CDR was greater than or equal to 0.7 in the eye showing loss. When multiple VFs were available and the latest available VF did not show minimal criteria for a NFL defect then the patient was excluded as a POAG case.    7. Cases in GEP all had less than 8 diopters of myopia. There was no refractive error inclusion/exclusion criterion for cases in NHS and HPFS.  **Control inclusion criteria:**    1. Age  40 years old.    2. European-derived Caucasian or Hispanic Caucasian.    3. Because the study also aimed for the discovery of gene environment interactions in POAG, controls from NHS and HPFS (where extensive environmental exposure data was available) were allowed to have a family history of glaucoma in 1st degree relatives (parent, sibling or child) or 2nd degree relatives (aunts, uncles, and cousins). Controls from GEP with a family history of glaucoma in 1st degree relatives were excluded, but they could have a 2nd degree relative with glaucoma.    4. There were no specific criteria for exclusion based on refractive status for participants in the NHS and HPFS. In the GEP, participants with more than 8 diopters of myopia were excluded.    5. For controls in GEP, it was required that slit lamp exam findings did not reveal a secondary cause for elevated intraocular pressure. Specifically, there were no signs of exfoliation syndrome, pigment dispersion syndrome, uveitis or ocular trauma on slit lamp examination. Controls in NHS and HPFS did not report a diagnosis of glaucoma or IOP > 25 mm Hg in either eye in the biennial questionnaires (but there is a remote possibility that some participants had slit lamp signs of pigment dispersion syndrome, exfoliation syndrome, uveitis or prior ocular trauma as these were not assessed in the biennial questionnaires).    6. For controls in GEP, slit lamp exam showed > 0.25 for the corneal thickness anterior chamber depth at the peripheral cornea with the van Herick technique. Subjects with shallower anterior chamber depth with the van Herick technique had gonioscopy showing the filtration apparatus to be open to the filtering portion of the trabecular meshwork for at least 180 degrees. For controls in NHS and HPFS, there was no exclusion criterion on the basis of anterior chamber depth.    7. For controls in GEP, participants with IOP > 21 mm Hg in either eye by applanation tonometry were excluded. In NHS and HPFS, only controls who denied a report that they were aware of an IOP > 25 mm Hg in either eye were included; otherwise, there was no exclusion criterion on the basis of IOP.    8. For controls in GEP, the CDR was less than 0.7 in both eyes and the CDR asymmetry was less than 0.2 on fundus examination of the optic nerve. In NHS and HPFS, there was no inclusion/exclusion criterion on the basis of optic nerve appearance.  **Exclusions in cases and controls:**    1. People of Asian or African decent were excluded.    2. People under the age of 40 years old were excluded.    3. Potential cases in whom the most recent available VF is reliable and normal in both eyes were excluded; these were ineligible regardless of prior VF findings and regardless of the disc appearance.    4. Patients with significant retinal vascular disease (such as retinal venous occlusive disease or proliferative diabetic retinopathy treated with pan-retinal photocoagulation) that could produce VF defects were excluded.  Note #1. There were no exclusions for IOP among POAG cases because POAG occurs across the entire spectrum of IOP (A World Glaucoma Society consensus statement, ARVO 2007). Cases of "normal tension glaucoma" will be analyzed together with "high tension" open-angle glaucoma as there is no epidemiologic evidence that clearly separates these two populations.  Note #2. There is a wide spectrum of CDRs associated glaucomatous optic neuropathy owing to the variation in disc size and shape that exists in the population. Thus, there were no _a priori_ disc structural criteria for POAG if there were no supporting VF data.  :::Human660W-Quad_v1_A:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Glaucoma, Open-Angle ][1]    * [ Low Tension Glaucoma ][2]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68005902[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68057066[uid]  :::Study History   The NHS and HPFS were initiated in 1976 and 1986 respectively, when 121,000 registered nurses participated and 51,529 male health professionals completed detailed questionnaires about lifestyle and general health. Questionnaires have been repeated every year and the content of these questionnaires can be found at the following websites: [www.channing.harvard.edu/nhs][1] and [www.hsph.harvard.edu/hpfs/hpfs_qx.htm][2]. Follow-up has been approximately 85% of the total person time of follow-up.  In 1990, questions regarding ocular health were added to the biennial questionnaires in both the NHS and HPFS cohort. In 1996, under the direction of Dr. Susan Hankinson, Dr. Jae Hee Kang formed the cohort at risk for POAG. In 2004, Dr. Pasquale, capitalizing on DNA samples collected from 1990 through 2004, studied the relation between candidate gene-environment interactions in POAG. This provided an opportunity to expand the cohort at risk for POAG and to form a case-control group nested within that cohort. This nested case- control group served as the basis for the NHS/HPFS portion of this case- control group.  In 1996, Dr. Janey Wiggs began her study of the genetic determinants of POAG. In 2000, she published a low-density genome wide scan for POAG, a study that demonstrated that POAG is a polygenetic disease. Subsequent funding allowed for the expansion of her clinic-based repository, which served as the basis for the GEP component of this case-control cohort.

phs000479.v1.p1::: National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Exome sequencing in SCID:::Study Description   Analysis of the molecular etiologies of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) has led to important insights into the control of immune cell development. Most cases of SCID result from either X-linked or autosomal recessive inheritance of mutations in a known causative gene. However, in some cases, the molecular etiology remains unclear. To identify the cause of SCID in a patient known to lack the protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45, we utilized single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) arrays and whole exome sequencing. The patient's mother was heterozygous for an inactivating mutation in _CD45_, while the paternal alleles lacked mutations. The patient exhibited a single _CD45_ mutation identical to the maternal allele. Patient SNP array analysis revealed no change in copy number but loss of heterozygosity for the entire length of chromosome 1 (Chr1), indicating that disease was caused by uniparental disomy (UPD) with isodisomy of the entire maternal Chr1 bearing the _CD45_ mutation. Non-lymphoid blood cells and other mesoderm and ectoderm- derived tissues retained UPD of the entire maternal Chr1 in this patient who had undergone successful bone marrow transplantation. Exome sequencing revealed mutations in 7 additional genes bearing nonsynonymous SNPs predicted to have deleterious effects. These findings represent the first reported case of SCID caused by UPD and suggest UPD should be considered in SCID and other recessive disorders, especially when the patient appears homozygous for an abnormal gene found in only one parent. Evaluation for alterations in other genes affected by UPD should also be considered in such cases.    * Study Type: Parent-Offspring Trios    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 3  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Parent-Offspring Trios::: 3:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000328.v1.p1::: High density copy number analysis and whole exome sequencing of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma:::Study Description   Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) represents the most common form of B-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL), accounting for ~30% of the de-novo diagnoses and also arising as a frequent clinical evolution of Follicular Lymphoma (FL). The molecular pathogenesis of DLBCL is associated with multiple genetic lesions that in part distinctly segregate with individual phenotypic subtypes, suggesting the involvement of distinct oncogenic pathways. However, the lesions identified so far likely represent only a fraction of those necessary for malignant transformation. In order to characterize the entire set of structural alterations present in the DLBCL genome, we have integrated next generation whole exome sequencing analysis of 7 DLBCL cases and genome- wide high-density SNP array analysis of 72 DLBCL cases. We report here that FL and DLBCL harbor frequent structural alterations inactivating CREBBP, and more rarely, EP300, two highly related histone and non-histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that act as transcriptional co-activators in multiple signaling pathways. Overall, ~37% of DLBCL and 36% of FL cases display genomic deletions and/or somatic point mutations that remove or inactivate the HAT coding domain of these two genes. These lesions commonly affect a single allele, suggesting that reduction in HAT dosage is important for lymphomagenesis. We demonstrate specific defects in the acetylation-mediated inactivation of the BCL6 onco- protein and activation of the p53 tumor suppressor. These results identify CREBBP/EP300 mutations as a major pathogenetic mechanism shared by common forms of B-NHL, and have direct implications for the use of drugs targeting acetylation/deacetylation mechanisms.    * Study Type: Tumor vs. Matched-Normal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 77  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Tumor vs. Matched-Normal::: 77:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000279.v1.p1::: NHLBI GO-ESP: Early-Onset Myocardial Infarction (Broad EOMI):::Study Description   The NHLBI "Grand Opportunity" Exome Sequencing Project (GO-ESP), a signature project of the NHLBI Recovery Act investment, was designed to identify genetic variants in coding regions (exons) of the human genome (the "exome") that are associated with heart, lung and blood diseases. These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied. These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease, contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention and treatments to specific populations. This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects. GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers - BroadGO and SeattleGO.  In the Grand Opportunities Exome Sequencing Program Early MI Project (GO ESP - EOMI), we are sequencing cases with extremely early-onset MI drawn from 8 cohorts. These cohorts include five hospital or community-based studies that ascertained individuals based on MI status. These include PennCATH, Cleveland Clinic Genebank, Massachusetts General Hospital Premature Coronary Artery Disease Study (MGH-PCAD), Heart Attack Risk in Puget Sound (HARPS), and Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Myocardial Infarction Patients' Health Status (TRIUMPH). Cases were selected based on MI occurring in men aged 50 years and women aged 60 years. In addition, early- MI cases are being drawn from three population-cohort studies including the Framingham Heart Study, the Women's Health Initiative, and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. MI-free controls are being drawn from five population-based cohort studies including the Framingham Heart Study, the Women's Health Initiative, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, Cardiovascular Health Study, and the Jackson Heart Study. Controls were selected based on two factors: (1) highest predicted risk for MI based on Framingham risk score; and (2) absence of prevalent or incident MI despite a high predicted risk.    * Study Weblink: [NHLBI GO ESP Project][1]    * Study Types: Longitudinal, Case-Control, Exome Sequencing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 219  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://esp.gs.washington.edu/drupal/  :::Longitudinal, Case-Control, Exome Sequencing::: 219:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000341.v2.p1::: The Genetic Basis of Hypodiploid ALL:::Study Description   The genetic basis of hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a subtype of ALL characterized by aneuploidy and poor outcome, is unknown. Genomic profiling of 124 hypodiploid ALL cases, including whole-genome and exome sequencing of 40 cases, identified two subtypes that differ in the severity of aneuploidy, transcriptional profiles and submicroscopic genetic alterations. Near-haploid ALL with 24-31 chromosomes harbor alterations targeting receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and Ras signaling (71%) and the lymphoid transcription factor gene IKZF3 (encoding AIOLOS; 13%). In contrast, low- hypodiploid ALL with 32-39 chromosomes are characterized by alterations in TP53 (91.2%) that are commonly present in nontumor cells, IKZF2 (encoding HELIOS; 53%) and RB1 (41%). Both near-haploid and low-hypodiploid leukemic cells show activation of Ras-signaling and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-signaling pathways and are sensitive to PI3K inhibitors, indicating that these drugs should be explored as a new therapeutic strategy for this aggressive form of leukemia.    * Study Types: Case Set, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal, Xenograft    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 241  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal, Xenograft::: 241:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000477.v1.p1::: Genetic defects in familial renal disorders:::Study Description     1. Several different genes cause, when mutated, increased urinary phosphate excretion and hypophosphatemia leading to rickets/osteomalacia; however, the majority of phosphate-wasting disorders has not yet been defined at the molecular level. Identification of phosphate-regulating genes has provided important novel insights into the mechanism contributing to phosphate homeostasis, which remains incompletely understood. We therefore pursue exome- wide nucleotide sequence analysis to define the underlying mutations, which is expected to provide novel insights into the regulation of this important mineral.    2. Virtually nothing is known about the genetic mutations that cause non- syndromic structural abnormalities involving the urinary tract, which represent about 50% of the causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The completion of the human genome project and the technological advances that allow low cost whole exome sequencing have now made it feasible to readily search for the cause of different inherited disorders in humans, particularly if clinical information and genomic DNA is available from larger kindreds with multiple affected members that can be used for mapping the disease-causing genetic locus. Furthermore, catalogs were generated that document the expression profiles of numerous genes during embryonic, fetal, and postnatal development, thereby supporting the exploration of kidney involvement in animal models of different diseases and in human genetic syndromes. We therefore plan to define the mechanisms leading to inherited disorders of the urogenital tract and the kidneys by establishing the causative genetic defects through a combination of genetic mapping and whole exome sequencing.    3. Hajdu-Cheney Syndrome (HCS) is a rare autosomal-dominant skeletal disorder characterized by severe osteoporosis, acroosteolysis of the distal phalanges, renal cysts and other abnormalities. Our goal is to identify the genetic cause of HCS using exome sequencing.    4. Opsismodysplasia is a very rare recessive spondylometaphyseal dysplasia characterized by delayed epiphyseal ossification, shortness of bones and sometimes low serum phosphate levels. Discovery of the causing mutation will give us insights into the pathogenesis of this often lethal disease.    * Study Types: Probands, Mendelian, Family    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 21  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Probands, Mendelian, Family::: 21:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000456.v1.p1::: Risk Assessment of Cerebrovascular Events (RACE) Study:::Study Description   This study includes 1,220 cases with young onset stroke (stroke before age 60 years) who are participants of the larger RACE study. Risk Assessment of Cerebrovascular Events (RACE) is an on-going existing case-control study of stroke now involving over 5000 imaging confirmed cases of stroke and 5000 controls, recruited from seven centers in Pakistan. The study is aimed to investigate the genetic, biomarker and lifestyle determinants of stroke and its subtypes. Cases are **eligible for inclusion** in the study if they: (i) are aged at least 18 years; (ii) present with a sudden onset of neurological deficit respecting a vascular territory with sustained deficit at 24 hours verified by medical attention within 72 hours after onset (onset is defined by when the patient was last seen normal and not when found with deficit); and (iii) the diagnosis is supported by CT/MRI; and (iv) present with a Modified Rankin Score < 2 prior to the stroke. Findings from patient's history, 12-lead ECG and CT or MRI of the brain. The mandatory procedures for inclusion in this investigation are: (i) clinical verification of cerebrovascular event within 72 hours of onset; (ii) neuroimaging CT (non-contrast) or MRI (MRI is not a mandatory investigation but recorded whenever ordered by the attending physician); and (iii) 12-lead ECG. All other ancillary investigations ordered by the attending physician are recorded as well. The TOAST classification method is used to classify ischemic stroke based on aetiology whereas the Oxfordshire classification is used to classify stroke neuro-anatomically.  Control participants for this subset of young onset stroke were individuals enrolled in the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction Study (PROMIS), a case- control study of acute MI based in Pakistan. RACE capitalizes on the genetic data (including information on GWAS) that has already been collected from the healthy participants enrolled in PROMIS. RACE and PROMIS share similar methodology of recruitment. Participants from both these investigations are derived from similar catchment areas, hence providing an attractive opportunity for RACE to utilize PROMIS controls as common controls for genetic investigations. Controls in PROMIS were recruited following procedures and inclusion criteria as adopted for RACE cases. In order to minimize any potential selection biases, PROMIS controls selected for this stroke substudy were frequency matched to RACE cases based on age and gender and were recruited in the following order of priority: (1) non-blood related or blood related visitors of patients of the out-patient department; (2) non-blood related visitors of stroke patients; (3) patients of the out-patient department presenting with minor complaints (e.g. back pain, minor gastric complaints). Control subjects from the PROMIS study were genotyped at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute on the Illumina 660W Quad array. The Center for Non-Communicable Diseases, Pakistan, serves as the coordinating center for both RACE and PROMIS. More information on these research investigations can be found at [www.cncdpk.com.][1]  This young onset stroke component to the RACE study was funded through the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [www.genevastudy.org][2] as one of three studies designed to assess the genetics of young onset stroke and modification of genetic effects by smoking. GENEVA is part of the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). Genotyping of 1,220 young onset stroke cases was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). Data cleaning and harmonization were done at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.  This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, http://www.genevastudy.org) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to stroke through large-scale genome- wide association studies of cases and controls recruited within Pakistan.

phs000433.v1.p1::: The Sea Islands Genetic Network (SIGNET): Identifying genetic contributors to diabetes and dyslipidemia in African Americans:::Study Description   Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified genetic variants that influence diabetes risk in European populations, however most do not have a major impact on diabetes risk in populations of African descent. The African American (AA) population from the Sea Islands of coastal South Carolina and Georgia has high rates of type 2 diabetes, low levels of admixture, and in general, consume a diet rich in saturated fats. We postulate that this unique combination of ancestral and environmental factors results in a more consistent penetrance of diabetes risk alleles, as well as enrichment of risk alleles of African origin. The existing DNA samples and rich phenotypic data from the Sea Island Families Project comprise a unique resource for genetic studies of type 2 diabetes and related metabolic traits such as dyslipidemia. Our central hypothesis is that the increased risk for T2DM in AA compared with European American (EA) is due, in part, to susceptibility alleles of African origin, and that these alleles can be identified using a GWAS. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Identify genetic risk factors for type 2 diabetes utilizing DNA samples and data from the Sea Island Families Project, Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study recruited from SC, GA, NC, and AL; and a GWAS approach; 2) Identify genetic contributors to lipoprotein subclasses in African Americans using the lipoprotein subclass profile (particle size and concentration for multiple subclasses of VLDL, LDL, and HDL) assessed by NMR at LipoScience, Inc., and the GWAS data from Aim 1. The rationale for this project is that identification and validation of novel pathophysiological pathways and informed selection of candidate genes for diabetes risk will inform development of new, targeted prevention and treatment strategies in this underserved, high risk population.    * Study Types: Case-Control, Family    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 4291  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control, Family::: 4291:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000433  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   **Project SuGAR**  > Project SuGAR enlisted medical clinics, churches, and established organizations on the Sea Islands to aid in identifying patients with T2DM who belong to families with multiple affected members. Inclusion criteria included at least one affected sibling pair, no more than one of the parents affected with T2DM, and at least one parent still living. All members of families meeting these minimal criteria were studied after obtaining informed consent. Project SuGAR assessed medical, anthropometrical, and metabolic information on affected and non-affected family members. The data are based on a multipage questionnaire, detailed family history and medical history, standardized blood pressures, physical examination, body dimensions and estimation of percent body fat, and laboratory testing. Blood pressure measurements were taken in the dominant arm with the patient having been in the sitting position for 5 minutes. Measurements were made using a calibrated, automated cuff device (DynaMap, New Brunswick, NJ); diastolic and systolic values represent the mean of the last two out of three sequential readings taken 3 minutes apart. Weights were determined using electronic calibrated scales (Detecto, Cleveland, OH) at 8-10AM after voiding and before breakfast. Heights were measured with a portable Harpenden statiometer. Standard arm, waist, hip and thigh circumferences were recorded using a tension-controlled tape measure (Novel Products, Rockton, IL). Body composition was assessed by standard caliper measurements of skin fold thickness in men and women, and also by segmental bioelectric impedance analyzer. Blood samples were drawn from all individuals. 20-40 ml was used for DNA extraction and 20 ml for laboratory tests. Laboratory testing included NMR lipid profiles; complete blood count; electrolytes; creatinineBUN; liver function tests; hemoglobin A1C; fasting lipid panel (cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL); circulating islet cell antibodies (if diabetic); fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, and free fatty acids (FFA); and urine ACR. All non-diabetic family members have been evaluated with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with measurement of glucose and insulin. In the initial phases, all diabetic patients were also studied with an OGTT, however, approximately half-way through the study, OGTTs were discontinued as a time/cost saving measure in those patients in whom diabetes was clearly evident based on clinical grounds and fasting glucose level. The criteria established by the National Diabetes Data Group as modified by the Expert Committee of the American Diabetes Association were used to define diabetes status.  **COBRE Oral Health**  > Additional AA diabetes patients have been recruited from the Sea Island population, as part of a previous South Carolina COBRE (Center of Biomedical Research Excellence) Oral Health pilot project, "An Epidemiological Study of Periodontal Disease and Diabetes: Cytokine Genes and Inflammation Factors" by Jyotika Fernandes, M.D. (MUSC). This is another study under the Sea Island Families Project umbrella. AA 18 years and older, with T2DM, living along the South Carolina border and 30 miles inland were included in the study. Type 1 diabetic individuals and edentulous patients were excluded from the study. All subjects answered a detailed questionnaire that focused on their medical and dental history. Blood and urine samples were collected for assessing diabetes control status and associated complications. These subjects underwent a single oral examination to document periodontal health. <p>  **SLE in Gullah Health (SLEIGH)**  > The Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus (SLE) in Gullah Health (SLEIGH) study (PI Gary Gilkeson, M.D.) is a population based case-control study of genetic and environmental risk factors for SLE. SLEIGH has been enrolling subjects since August 2003. All subjects have been enrolled through MUSC and the Medical College of Georgia. The inclusion criteria are: 1) age &#8805;2 years, 2) self-identification as AA Gullah from the Sea Islands region of South Carolina, with no known ancestors who were not of Gullah lineage, 3) having met at least 4 of the 11 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for SLE, 4) being able to speak and understand English, and 5) having the ability and willingness to give informed consent. First-degree relatives of the lupus probands are also invited to enroll. The subjects&#39; parents and grandparents were also required to be of Sea Islands heritage. SLEIGH recruits healthy AA subjects from the Sea Islands community as age- and sex- matched controls, with the requirement that they must not have any history of autoimmune disease or known family members with SLE. In addition, these subjects had to have &lt;4 positive responses on a connective tissue diseases screening questionnaire, and &lt;3 of the ACR classification criteria for SLE. Blood and urine specimens are collected for DNA and disease activity labs. <p>  **Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS)**  > The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study is a national, population-based, longitudinal study of 30,000 AA and EA adults. Participants were randomly sampled with recruitment by mail then telephone. Individuals aged 45 years old and older were eligible for inclusion in the REGARDS cohort, for which enrollment began in February 2003. Exclusion criteria for REGARDS participation included active treatment for cancer; any serious medical condition which would prevent long-term participation; cognitive impairment as judged by the interviewer; living in a nursing home or on the waiting list for a nursing home; and a language barrier (speaks other than English). <p>  :::AFFY_6.0:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ][1]    * [ Dyslipidemia ][2]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68003924[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68050171[uid]  ::: :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigators **      * Michele M.

phs000256.v2.p2::: The Vaginal Microbiome: Disease, Genetics and the Environment:::Study Description   The vagina is an interactive interface with the environment, and as such is covered by a protective epithelial surface. This surface is colonized by bacteria and other microorganisms which, through a variety of mechanisms serve to further protect the host from invasion by pathogens. Alterations in the normal vaginal microflora, particularly those associated with bacterial vaginosis, are thought to contribute to risk of spontaneous pregnancy loss in the second trimester and spontaneous preterm birth. Additionally, alterations in the vaginal microbiome may increase the likelihood of transmission of certain agents including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). There are physiologic alterations in host condition (e.g., menopause and pregnancy), which are beginning to be investigated as potential selective conditions for change in the "normal" flora, and their impact on disease susceptibility and transmission remains to be more definitively elucidated. The effects of chronically abnormal physiologic states (e.g., diabetes mellitus) on normal vaginal flora have not been well described or studied. Finally, an almost unexplored area of inquiry is the genetic contribution, including race/ethnicity, to the establishment and maintenance of a "normal" vaginal flora, under normal and physiologically altered circumstances. Our research will shed light on how the vaginal microbiome contributes to adverse obstetrical outcomes and sexually transmitted infections in diverse populations. This project addresses the following questions:  **First: Do the genes of the host contribute to the composition of the vaginal microbiome?** We hypothesize that a woman's genetic composition significantly affects the ability of certain commensal, parasitic and pathogenic microbes to colonize and/or infect the genital tract. Thus, we will compare and quantify the microbial populations inhabiting the vaginas of monozygotic and dizygotic twins from the Mid Atlantic Twin Registry, and, in the process, address the question of whether there is a relationship between the microbiomes of the vagina, mouth and GI tract.  **Second: What changes in the vaginal microbiome are associated with common physiological perturbations or non-infectious pathological states of the host?**We hypothesize that "altered" physiologic (pregnancy, menopause) and pathologic (chronic disease, hysterectomy) conditions, or environmental "exposures" (exogenous hormones, antibiotics, chronic immunosuppressant, smoking; douching) can predictably alter the vaginal microenvironment. These alterations will lead to changes in microbial populations within the vagina. Changes in the microbial populations may have impacts, positive or more likely negative, on the spontaneous and future well-being of the affected individual. We are characterizing the effects of these "altered" physiologic and pathologic conditions, and environmental exposures, on the composition of the vaginal microbiome.  **Third: What changes in the vaginal microbiome are associated with relevant infectious diseases and conditions?** We are testing the hypothesis that infectious diseases predictably alter the vaginal microbiome, and that these changes have an impact on the disease susceptibility, process, and outcome. A predilection for bacterial vaginosis, vaginitis, HIV infection, or other sexually transmitted diseases, is likely associated with a women's vaginal microbial composition. Thus, we will characterize samples from women with a variety of these infectious conditions to determine the contribution of their micriobiomes to the disease process and susceptibility.  We are addressing these questions using a combination of high throughput 'nextgen' sequencing technologies, including the Roche 454 FLX and the upgraded Illumina Genome Analyzer II instruments currently installed in the Nucleic Acids Research Facilities at VCU. Thus, segments of the 16S rRNA genes will be amplified from the complex samples taken from various target sites in and around the vagina of each study participant. These segments will be sequenced and subjected to taxonomic classification protocols to identify and quantify the bacterial taxa present in each sample. Additionally, total DNA isolated from these samples will be subjected to shotgun sequence analysis to empirically reconstruct the metabolic potential of these microbiomes. Finally, specific bacterial clones will be completely sequenced and analyzed to associate the unavoidable strain and isolate diversity with the clinical phenotypes presented.    * Study Types: Twin, Clinical Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1010  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Twin, Clinical Cohort::: 1010:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000423.v1.p1::: Genome wide association study for early onset coronary disease and related phenotypes (ADVANCE):::Study Description   ADVANCE (Atherosclerotic Disease, VAscular functioN, and genetiC Epidemiology) is a large epidemiological study of genetic and non-genetic determinants of coronary artery disease (CAD) that started in 2000 as a collaborative effort between researchers at Stanford University and Kaiser Permanente of Northern California. The overarching goal of the study is to improve our ability to prevent, diagnose and treat CAD. The initial study included recruitment of over 3600 subjects (including 1873 subjects with incident clinically significant coronary disease and 1745 control subjects) from multiple race/ethnic backgrounds. A subset of ~ 500 subjects with very early onset coronary disease (men < 45 and women < 55) and ~ 500 similar aged controls were genotyped using the Illumina 550K platform as part of an NIH funded effort within the STAMPEED consortium.    * Study Weblink: [ADVANCE][1]    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 0  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://med.stanford.edu/advance/  :::Case-Control::: 0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Cases and controls were identified from over 2.9 million enrollees in KPNC, an ethnically diverse population representative of the local and statewide population. Eligible subjects were identified using the KPNC electronic databases and those who agreed to participate were interviewed and examined at one of several clinics in the San Francisco Bay Area. To allow for several pre-specified contrasts, a specialized recruitment strategy was devised. Between October 28, 2001 and December 31, 2003, we assembled a study including over 3,600 subjects with detailed clinical information and blood for DNA and protein studies.  **ADVANCE Phase I**  At the time of the [ADVANCE Phase I study][1], there were technological limitations that made it impossible to survey the entire human genome for genetic polymorphisms that are associated with coronary disease. Thus, initially our approach focused on a more limited candidate gene based approach. We selected candidate genes on the basis of results of local genomic experiments and an extensive review of the literature. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in each of the candidate gene loci through a process of SNP discovery, and a subset of these SNPs were genotyped in all participants in the ADVANCE Study to compare case and control groups with the respect to the acquisition or progression of atherosclerotic disease.  Details regarding the candidate genes, SNPs and genotyping strategy studied in ADVANCE Phase I are available through the ADVANCE web site. The first phase of ADVANCE was funded through a generous grant from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation, Las Vegas from October 2000 until June 2006.  **ADVANCE Phase II**  In ADVANCE Phase II, we performed a high density GWA scan using over 550,000 SNPs on a population of highly selected and characterized cohort of young individuals with premature CAD from ADVANCE. This phase of ADVANCE is largely being funded by a grant from the NHLBI that will ran from October 1, 2006 through July 31, 2009 as part of the STAMPEED effort.  GWA data from the ADVANCE project has been used as part of several large meta- analyses including consortia concerned with coronary disease (CARDIOGRAM) and anthropomorphic traits (GIANT). Through dbGaP, analysis data is available.

EGAS00000000051::: A small cell lung cancer genome reports complex tobacco exposure signatures:::Study Description       Cancer is driven by mutation. Worldwide, tobacco smoking is the major lifestyle exposure that causes cancer, exerting carcinogenicity through 60 chemicals that bind and mutate DNA. Using massively parallel sequencing technology, we sequenced a small cell lung cancer cell line, NCI-H209, to explore the mutational burden associated with tobacco smoking. 22,910 somatic substitutions were identified, including 132 in coding exons. Multiple mutation signatures testify to the cocktail of carcinogens in tobacco smoke and their proclivities for particular bases and surrounding sequence context. Effects of transcription-coupled repair and a second, more general expression- linked repair pathway were evident. We identified a tandem duplication that duplicates exons 3-8 of CHD7 in-frame, and another two lines carrying PVT1-CHD7 fusion genes, suggesting that CHD7 may be recurrently rearranged in this disease. These findings illustrate the potential for next-generation sequencing to provide unprecedented insights into mutational processes, cellular repair pathways and gene networks associated with cancer.    * Study Weblink: [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000051][1]    * Study Type: Whole Genome Sequencing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access:  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000051  :::Whole Genome Sequencing:::0::: ::: ::: ::: ::: :::

phs000430.v1.p1::: Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment Against Cirrhosis (HALT-C):::Study Description   Reprinted from http://www.haltctrial.org/  **Purpose**  The **H**epatitis C **A**ntiviral **L**ong-term **T**reatment against **C**irrhosis (HALT-C) Trial is a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term use of pegylated interferon for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in patients who failed to respond to previous interferon therapy. The HALT-C Trial was developed to determine whether prolonged interferon therapy altered histological and clinical outcomes in a group of patients who had failed to eradicate hepatitis C virus with previous interferon treatment.  **Study Hypotheses**    1. In patients with chronic hepatitis C and bridging fibrosis who failed to eradicate the virus with previous interferon therapy, long-term treatment with interferon is safe and can prevent progression to cirrhosis.    2. In patients with cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis C who failed to eradicate the virus with previous interferon therapy, long-term treatment with interferon is safe and can reduce the risks of hepatic decompensation or of hepatocellular carcinoma.  **Study Design**  1145 patients with chronic HCV and advanced hepatic fibrosis (Ishak stage 3-6) who failed to respond to previous treatment with interferon were enrolled at 10 clinical centers and entered into a Lead-in phase. They were treated with a combination of pegylated interferon (Pegasys, Hoffmann-La Roche) 180 g/week and ribavirin (1000-1200 mg/day) for 24 weeks. Patients who had no detectable HCV-RNA at week 20 continued on combination therapy until week 48.  662 patients who did not clear virus were randomly assigned at week 24 to either continue treatment with pegylated interferon alone (90 g/week) for an additional 42 months, or to have treatment discontinued. All patients were followed at 3-month intervals following randomization. Liver biopsy was performed at baseline and after 1.5 and 3.5 years of treatment.  Because of slower than expected enrollment and the approval by the FDA of peginterferon alfa-2b after the start of the trial, we modified the study protocol in three ways. First, criteria for admission to the trial were liberalized to allow patients to enter the trial with lower platelet and white blood cell counts than had been initially considered safe or tolerable. Second, 151 Lead-in patients and those continuing on therapy after 24 weeks who demonstrated return of viremia during or after their 48-week treatment period (called "Breakthrough" or "Relapse" patients, respectively) were allowed to return to enter the randomized trial. Third, 237 patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2b (or with peginterferon alfa-2a in licensing trials) outside the HALT-C Trial who in other respects met all study criteria, having received the equivalent of Trial Lead-in period therapy, were allowed to enter the long-term trial as "Express" patients.  A total 1050 patients were randomized.  Those patients who completed Month 48 were offered an "extended follow-up (observation only)" until October 2009. These visits will primarily be to identify outcome events, and to provide information to patients concerning the current status of the trial. Some questionnaires, blood tests, and an ultrasonogram will be performed.  _Quarterly (every 3 months)_    * Interval history of complications, adverse events    * Current medications    * Brief physical examination    * Laboratory tests: liver panel, CBC, INR, AFP    * Child-Pugh Score    * Stored serum  _Annual_    * Complete physical examination    * Ultrasound of liver  _1.5 years (M24 visit, middle of study)_    * Liver biopsy: formalin fixed histology, frozen liver tissue (subset of patients)  _3.5 years (M48, end of study)_    * Liver biopsy: formalin fixed histology, frozen liver tissue (subset of patients)    * Endoscopy: evaluate esophageal varices and portal hypertension  _After Month 48_    * Observation only (no treatment) to determine clinical outcomes    * Clinic visit every 6 months with current medications, brief PE, liver panel, CBC, AFP, stored    * Serum    * Ultrasound of liver every 6 months  **Outcome Variables**  Primary outcome variables to be assessed in the two groups of patients include:    * Development of cirrhosis on liver biopsy (progression of Ishak fibrosis score by 2 points or more)    * Development of hepatic decompensation, as shown by:      * Sustained increase in the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score to 7 points or higher      * Variceal hemorrhage      * Ascites      * Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis      * Hepatic encephalopathy      * Development of hepatocellular carcinoma      * Death  Secondary outcomes include quality of life, serious adverse events, events requiring dose reductions, and development of presumed hepatocellular carcinoma.    * Study Weblink: [HALT-C][1]    * Study Type: Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 966  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.haltctrial.org/  :::Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial::: 966:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000313.v3.p2::: SardiNIA Medical Sequencing Discovery Project:::Study Description   The SardiNIA Medical Sequencing Discovery Project is a study of the genetics of blood lipid levels and personality in a Sardinian population cohort. The project will generate draft genome sequences for 1,000 individuals using whole genome shotgun sequencing. The draft sequences will allow investigators to evaluate the contribution of common (frequency >5.0%) and rare (frequency 0.5 - 5.0%) single nucleotide polymorphisms, short insertions and deletions, large copy number polymorphisms and other structural variants to blood levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and triglycerides (TG), all of which are key risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and to the 5 domains of personality as assessed by NEO-PI-R questionnaire. The two traits represent different ends of the spectrum of medically interesting complex traits. Blood lipid levels are risk factor for cardiovascular disease for which genetic studies have been very successful. In contrast, personality traits and other behavioral phenotypes represent a set of phenotypes that have proven more challenging to dissect using standard genetic tools. In both cases, we expect whole genome sequencing to improve our understanding of the underlying biology.  The isolated Sardinian population is ideal for this type of study for several reasons, and in particular because: (i) the bottleneck that occurred after colonization of the island attenuated natural selection against alleles with phenotypic consequences, increasing the odds that functional alleles will reach modest frequencies (0.5 - 5.0%) and will be detected in the present study and (ii) sharing of long haplotype stretches surrounding rare variants will facilitate imputation based analyses of shotgun sequence data, which improve the accuracy of individual genotype calls and thus increase power.  This research helps advance NIH's mission by furthering our understanding of the genetic factors contributing to blood lipid levels and coronary heart disease and to personality, behavior and mental health. In addition, these data should facilitate development of analysis tools and strategies that can be used to study the genomes of hundreds to thousands of individuals and further our understanding of the genetics and biology of many different traits and conditions.    * Study Weblink: [SardiNIA Sequencing Study][1]    * Study Types: Family, Population    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1887  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/SardiNIA  :::Family, Population::: 1887:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000006.v1.p1::: The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Human Genetics Resource Center: DNA and Cell Line Repository (the NINDS Repository): Motor Neuron/Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Study:::Study Description   The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Human Genetics Resource Center: DNA and Cell Line Repository ([the NINDS Repository][1]), banks phenotypic data and biological samples, including from individuals with motor neuron disease, in order to facilitate gene discovery in neurological disorders. Those samples are used in a number of studies, and genotyping data from studies using this resource are encouraged to be shared via dbGaP. Many studies have already shared data in this fashion, which in turn, can be linked back to the biologicals banked at the NINDS Repository.  Motor Neuron Disease is characterized by selective degeneration of the motor neurons of the spinal cord, brainstem, or motor cortex. Clinical subtypes are distinguished by the major site of degeneration. In Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), there is involvement of upper, lower, and brainstem motor neurons. In progressive muscular atrophy and related syndromes, the motor neurons in the spinal cord are primarily affected. With progressive bulbar palsy, the initial degeneration occurs in the brainstem. In primary lateral sclerosis, the cortical neurons are affected in isolation (Adams et al, Principles of Neurology, 6th ed, p 1089). The Motor Neuron Disease Collection of DNA and cell lines in the NINDS Repository is largely Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis cases (others include progressive muscular atrophy, primary lateral sclerosis, progressive bulbar palsy, Kennedy's disease). Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of motor neuron disease (MND). Although ALS is the most common MND, it is still a relatively rare disease with an incidence of around 1.6 per 100,000 in the United States. It is currently incurable and treatment is largely limited to supportive care. Family history is associated with an increased risk of ALS, and many Mendelian causes have been discovered (including SOD1). However, most forms of the disease are not obviously familial. It is suspected that the sporadic forms of neurodegenerative disorders are caused by multiple genetic variants that individually make relatively weak contributions to risk.  There is also an associated Control collection (see [dbGaP][2] and [ Coriell][3]).

These elements were developed to permit researchers using the specimens to apply to the El Escorial Criteria for the diagnosis of ALS at more than one level of stringency in a standardized fashion. Additionally, these were designed towards allowing broad pooling of multiple sample sets, since there are many international groups collecting samples for ALS gene discovery with which those from this effort could ultimately be pooled to achieve larger sample sizes and thus greater power to detect genes of risk. These CDEs also query exclusionary features, such as electrophysiological, CSF, imaging or other findings suggestive of confounding diagnoses. Data dictionaries have been designed by the collaboration (E. Kasarkis and K. Bednarz) and are publicly available to allow rapid referencing of all phenotypic terms at [ Coriell][2].  For a given data element, the rules listed below were used to decide if the sample should be included in the collection. All required data must be present if a sample was included in the collection to ensure a standard data set for all samples.  _Element_  _Rule_  Age or month/yr  Required: Must give one or other  Gender  Required  Race  Required  Ethnicity  Required  Age or month/yr of diagnosis  Required  Age or month/yr of onset weakness  Required  Clinician source  Required  Family history  Required  Medical history  Must check all that apply  Primary clinical diagnosis  Required: Only one may be chosen  Secondary clinical diagnosis  Required: Must check one or not applicable  Site of onset weakness  Required: Must check only one  Current treatment  Required: May be N/A or may be multiple  Upper motor, lower motor, and emg  Required: Only one should be chosen  Genetics  Required: One or more must be checked.

In 2004, ALS was added as one of the diseases banked. To facilitate complex gene discovery in ALS, the NINDS Repository (under a contract with Coriell Cell Repositories, # N01-NS-2-2349), in collaboration with The ALS Association (ALSA), The Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) and academic scientists from 62 centers across the United States, developed a program for evaluation of individuals affected with ALS, neurologically normal controls, and banking of their blood samples and clinical data. This unique public-private collaboration facilitated leverage of resources to develop this collection broadly across the United States.  Many of the clinicians in this collaboration are members of the ALS Research Group (ALSRG) who collected samples under the supplement mechanism, NOT- NS-03-016. Investigators who had been collecting and banking samples as a part of the overall NINDS-funded effort in ALS gene discovery have also contributed to this effort, and continue to do so in an ongoing fashion.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Co-Investigators **      * J.C.

phs000485.v1.p1::: Gene mutation and rescue in congenital diaphragmatic hernia:::Study Description   Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) is a common and life-threatening malformation. The most common phenotype is left-sided posterolateral (Bochdalek-type) hernia accompanied by pulmonary hypoplasia. Due to the high mortality, most of the cases have no family history for CDH. The rare presumed Mendelian instances of CDH have the potential to be extremely informative about the molecular mechanisms generating this phenotype. Three multiplex families were deemed meritorious for study by whole exome sequencing:    1. Parents who were 1st cousins gave birth to 2 children with CDH (one of whom also had cleft lip and palate), both now deceased. A DNA sample was available from one child. We proposed to perform a SNP array to identify regions of homozygosity by descent and intersect these regions with variants detected on exome sequencing. This effort has led to the identification of 3 confirmed variants. We are determining which if any are expressed in the primordial developing diaphragm and are also using bioinformatic approaches to determine which of these candidates interact with known CDH genes.    2. This non-consanguineous couple gave birth to 2 affected boys with an identical and lethal CDH phenotype (consisting of diaphragmatic hernia, epigastric hernia, and facial dysmorphism) and one healthy boy. We predicted X-linked inheritance and findings from X chromosome microsatellite marker analysis are consistent with this. Accordingly, we are focusing on sequence variants mapping to the X chromosome. We have identified a single candidate gene and confirmed that the variant follows an X-linked pattern of inheritance in all family members. Expression studies are underway.    3. These affected males are second cousins. By virtue of their position in the pedigree, we predicted an inheritance pattern consistent with X-linked inheritance. Data from WES and microsatellite marker analysis are currently being integrated.    * Study Weblink: [Massachusetts General Hospital/Pediatric Surgical Research Laboratories][1]    * Study Types: Probands, Mendelian, Family    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 4  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.massgeneral.org/research/researchlab.aspx?id=1486  :::Probands, Mendelian, Family::: 4:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000179.v3.p2::: Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute:::Study Description   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and the only leading cause of death that is steadily increasing in frequency. This project will establish a racially diverse cohort that is sufficiently large and appropriately designed for genome-wide association analysis of COPD. A total of 10,000 subjects will be recruited, including control smokers, definite COPD cases (GOLD Stage 2 to 4), and subjects not included in either group (GOLD 1 or GOLD-Unclassified). This cohort will be used for cross-sectional analysis, although long-term longitudinal follow-up will be a future goal. The primary focus of the study will be genome-wide association analysis to identify the genetic risk factors that determine susceptibility for COPD and COPD-related phenotypes. Detailed phenotyping of both cases and controls, including chest CT scan assessment of emphysema and airway disease, will allow identification of genetic determinants for the heterogeneous components of the COPD syndrome. **The hypotheses to be studied are: 1) Precise phenotypic characterization of COPD subjects using computed tomography, as well as clinical and physiological measures, will provide data that will enable the broad COPD syndrome to be decomposed into clinically significant subtypes. 2) Genome-wide association studies will identify genetic determinants for COPD susceptibility that will provide insight into clinically relevant COPD subtypes. 3) Distinct genetic determinants influence the development of emphysema and airway disease.** The initial phase of genome-wide association analysis included 500 COPD cases and 500 control subjects (all non-Hispanic White) genotyped with the Illumina Omni-1 chip, but plans are being developed to obtain genome-wide association analysis on the entire study cohort (using the Illumina Omni-Express chip). Unique aspects of the study include: 1) Inclusion of large numbers of African American subjects (approximately 1/3 of the cohort); 2) Obtaining chest CT scans (including inspiratory and expiratory images); and 3) Inclusion of the full range of disease severity.  **The COPDGene Cohort is utilized in the following dbGaP sub-study.** To view genotypes, other molecular data, and derived variables collected in these sub- study, please click on the following sub-study below or in the "Sub-studies" box located on the right hand side of this top-level study page phs000179 COPDGene Cohort.    * [phs000296][1] ESP LungGO COPDGene    * Study Weblink: [COPDGene][2]    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 10364  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000296     [2]: http://www.copdgene.org  :::Case-Control::: 10364:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000285.v2.p2::: NHLBI Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Candidate Gene Association Resource (CARe):::Study Description   The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study is a study examining the development and determinants of clinical and subclinical cardiovascular disease and its risk factors. It began in 1985 with a group of 5115 black and white men and women aged 18-30 years. The participants were selected so that there would be approximately the same number of people in subgroups of race, gender, education (high school or less and more than high school) and age (18-24 and 25-30) in each of 4 centers: Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN; and Oakland, CA. These same participants were asked to participate in follow-up examinations during 1987-1988 (Year 2), 1990-1991 (Year 5), 1992-1993 (Year 7), 1995-1996 (Year 10), 2000-2001 (Year 15), and 2005-2006 (Year 20). A majority of the group has been examined at each of the follow-up examinations (90%, 86%, 81%, 79%, 74%, and 72%, respectively).  While the specific aims of each examination have varied, data have been collected on a variety of factors believed to be related to heart disease. These include conditions with clear links to heart disease such as blood pressure, cholesterol and other lipids, and glucose. Data have also been collected on physical measurements such as weight and skinfold fat as well as lifestyle factors such as substance use (tobacco and alcohol), dietary and exercise patterns, behavioral and psychological variables, medical and family history, and other chemistries (e.g., insulin). In addition, subclinical atherosclerosis was measured via echocardiography during Years 5 and 10, computed tomography during Years 15 and 20, and carotid ultrasound during Year 20.  **NHLBI Candidate-gene Association Resource.** The NHLBI initiated the Candidate gene Association Resource (CARe) to create a shared genotype/phenotype resource for analyses of the association of genotypes with phenotypes relevant to the mission of the NHLBI. The resource comprises nine cohort studies funded by the NHLBI including: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Cleveland Family Study (CFS), Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Jackson Heart Study (JHS), Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). A database of genotype and phenotype data was created that includes records for approximately 41,000 study participants with approximately 50,000 SNPs from more than 2,000 selected candidate genes.

phs000210.v1.p1::: A Genome-Wide Association Study in Patients Experiencing Musculoskeletal Adverse Events on NCIC CTG Trial MA.27 Evaluating Aromatase Inhibitors as Adjuvant Therapy in Early Breast Cancer.  A Collaboration Between the NIH Pharmacogenetics Research Network and the RIKEN Yokohama Institute Center for Genomic Medicine.:::Study Description   _Source of Patients_  > The source of the patients for this genome-wide case control study was MA.27, which was conducted as a multi-cooperative group effort under the auspices of the NCI Breast Cancer Intergroup of North America. The NCIC Clinical Trials Group (CTG) serves as the coordinating group, with participation by the NCI-sponsored North Central Cancer Treatment Group, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Southwest Oncology Group, and Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB). MA.27 involved postmenopausal women with histologically confirmed and completely resected invasive breast cancer with surgical margins clear of invasive carcinoma and DCIS in the following TMN categories (AJCC Version 6): pT1, pT2, pT3; pNx, pN0, pN1, pN2, pN3 (only when the sole basis is presence of 10 or more involved axillary nodes); MO. The primary tumor must have been ER andor progesterone receptor positive. Patients were stratified by lymph node status at diagnosis, prior adjuvant chemotherapy, and trastuzumab use and were randomized to 5 years of adjuvant therapy with anastrozole or exemestane. The trial was activated on May 26, 2003, and reached its accrual objectives on July 31, 2008, after the randomization of 6827 North American patients, with the majority (79%) providing DNA and consent for genetic testing. Non-North American patients were also entered by the International Breast Cancer Study Group but they did not contribute DNA. From 2003 to December 21, 2004, patients also underwent a second randomization to celecoxib 400 mg twice daily or placebo but, after the entry of 1,622 patients, this treatment was discontinued because of reports of increased cardiovascular risk associated with celecoxib.  _Case Definition for Musculoskeletal Adverse Events_  > Cases were defined to have had at least one of the following six MSAE): 1. pain - joint, 2. pain - muscle, 3. pain - bone, 4. arthritis, 5. joint - function, 6. musculoskeletal - other. Cases were required to have at least grade 3 toxicity, according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0, or go off treatment for any grade of the six MSAEs; and were required to have had an MSAE within the first two years (i.e., a MSAE occurring after 2 years was not be considered a case). Subjects were excluded from the case group who met the case definition while on celecoxib or in the three months after stopping celecoxib but subjects were allowed to be cases if they developed their first MSAE more than three months after stopping celecoxib. <p>  _Study Design_  > The design was a nested matched case-control study with two controls selected for each case. Random matching from the potential control group (i.e., risk-set sampling such that controls had at least the same length of followup as the timing of the case event) was done by matching the case on the following factors: 1. treatment arm (exemestane vs. anastrozole, blinded), 2. prior adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs. no), 3. age at start of treatment (+- 5 years), 4. Celecoxib allocation (yes vs. no). Attempts were made to exactly match each case with two controls according to the above criteria. If, however, controls could not be exactly matched, "close" matching was used to define a distance between each case and all potential controls in an optimal matching algorithm. Race is a potential confounding factor, and 94% of the MA.27 population is Caucasian, 3% are Black, 1% Asian, 1% American Indian, and 1% are of unknown race. Because there are so few non-Caucasian participants, was restricted to only Caucasians. Following identification of cases and controls, the list was sent to the CALGB Pathology Coordinating Office (PCO) at Ohio State University Medical Center for plating of the samples. Other patient factors that might influence the association of SNP genotypes with a MSAE, either as confounding factors or as effect modifiers, were included as investigational covariates. These include 1. body mass index (BMI), 2. bisphosphonate use, 3. fractures in past 10 years, 4. baseline ECOG performance status, 5. prior hormone replacement therapy, 6. prior adjuvant radiotherapy, and 7. prior taxane treatment. An Honest Broker Process was utilized to ensure patient confidentiality.  _Genotype Assays and Quality Control_  > A GWAS was performed with the Illumina Human610-Quad at the RIKEN Center for Genomic Medicine. The DNA for all of the samples were adjusted to a concentration of 50 to 100 ngL in a final volume of 50 L. The 96-well plates were designed to have a unique distribution pattern with x duplicates per plate to evaluate genotype concordance. Samples with <98% call rate were removed from analyses. SNPs with ambiguous call will be excluded using the following criteria: 1. low signal intensity of each allele, 2. low cluster separation score, 3. SNP call rate <0.98, 4. SNPs with Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium p-value <0.001 were excluded. X-chromosome SNPs were used to validate female sex and quality control measures were examined across the different submitting centers. For all pairs of subjects, the percentage of matching genotypes were computed to screen for unexpected duplicate samples. All SNPs found to be associated with MSAE were subjected to visual inspection of the cluster plots to verify that the genotype clustering was adequate.    * Study Type: Nested Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 879  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Nested Case-Control::: 879:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000262.v2.p1::: Ulcerative Colitis Human Microbiome Project (UCHMP):::Study Description   The aims of the multi-center Ulcerative Colitis Human Microbiome Project (UCHMP) are to examine the role of the enteric microbiome in causing human ulcerative colitis, specifically the development of pouchitis. Pouchitis is an inflammatory condition of the surgically-created ileoanal pouch that serves as a pseudo-rectum in patients with ulcerative colitis who have undergone a total colectomy. It is a condition unique to ulcerative colitis (UC), as it rarely occurs in non-UC patients who have the same procedure. Within one year, about 50% of patients will develop pouchitis. The condition is almost certainly due to aspects of the pouch microbiota on a background of genetic susceptibility, as most patients respond to treatment with antibiotics. While there have been reports on the microbiota in pouchitis patients, all have been performed after the inflammatory process is initiated, rendering interpretation of the results difficult, as the inflammatory process itself will change the microbiota.  **Our project is therefore unique and possibly the only opportunity in the role of the enteric microbiome in IBD in a prospective manner, thereby establishing potentially important causal relationships between microbiota structure or function and development of UC.** The studies also offer two additional advantages. First, the development of the pouch microbiota can be observed prospectively. Second, the cause of antibiotic treatment failure in some patients with pouchitis may be revealed. The two aims are (1) to identify causal factors in the structure and/or function of the enteric microbiota in the development of pouchitis, and (2) to determine the basis of treatment failure in UC pouchitis patients. Our analyses will include serial measurements of enteric microbial structure (16S rRNA gene-based), function (metagenomics and functional candidate genes), and cultivation, the latter to enhance interpretation of gene sequences derived from metagenomes and targeted gene surveys (either functional or 16S genes).  The insights gained from these studies will help us understand the fundamental and causative roles of the enteric microbiome in human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). This information will be the basis for developing strategies to restore host-microbial relationships to prevent and treat IBD.    * Study Type: Longitudinal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 23  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Longitudinal::: 23:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000361.v1.p1::: Genome-Wide Association Studies in Upper Gastrointestinal Cancers (Asian):::Study Description   This project aims to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in two anatomically different upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer sites in two populations with distinctly different disease rates and genetic profiles. One population has very high rates for both esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) and gastric cancers (GCs) and is comprised of Asians (**the "Asian UGI GWAS"**), while the other population has low rates of ESCC and GC and includes non-Asians from the Americas, Europe, and Australia (**the "Non-Asian UGI GWAS"**).  Study participants for the Asian UGI GWAS reported here (Illumina 660W Quad chip) were drawn from 2 studies, the Shanxi Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer Genetics Project (Shanxi) and the Linxian Nutrition Intervention Trial (NIT), a prospective cohort, and included a total of 1898 ESCCs, 1625 GCs, and 2100 controls. For the 2nd phase (8 TaqMan SNPs), additional subjects from Shanxi and NIT as well as subjects from the Shanghai Men's Health Study (SMHS), the Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS), and the Singapore Chinese Health Study (SCHS) were also included (217 ESCCs, 615 GCs, 1202 controls). Altogether 2115 ESCCs, 2240 GCs, and 3302 controls were genotyped in this study.    * Study Types: Case-Control, Case Set, Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 5623  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control, Case Set, Cohort::: 5623:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000490.v1.p1::: A Study of the Genetic Causes of Complex Pediatric Disorders:::Study Description   The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) is a high-throughput, highly automated genotyping and sequencing facility equipped with state-of-the-art genotyping and sequencing platforms. Children who are treated at the Children's Hospital Healthcare Network and their parents may be eligible to take part in a major initiative to collect more than 100,000 blood samples, covering a wide range of pediatric diseases.  A large majority of participants consenting to prospective genomic analyses also consent to analysis of their de-identified electronic medical records (EMRs). EMRs are longitudinal, with a mean duration of 6.5 years. CAG has committed to releasing genotype and phenotype data for 4000 individuals diagnosed with **asthma**, **ADHD**, **atopic dermatitis**, **GERD** (1000 for each), and 1000 individuals on the upper and lower ranges of **Low-Density Lipoprotein** (LDL) levels to dbGaP. We will also release genotype/phenotype of 3000 controls.  Relevant phenotype data includes primary diagnoses (ICD9 codes), secondary diagnoses (ICD9 codes), medical procedures/tests conducted in relation to the phenotype, and a listing of relevant medications.

It has been shown by Ng et al that the causative gene for rare syndromes can be unequivocally identified by sequencing the exomes of only four cases and eight controls. We expect exome sequencing to result in a high number of mutations and non-causitive coding variants.    * Study Weblink: [][1]    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access:  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]:  ::: :::0::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: 
phs000395.v1.p1::: California Pacific Medical Center Research Breast Health Cohort:::Study Description   _Description of Cohort_: The California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC) Breast Health Cohort is a cohort study based at CPMC and is linked to the San Francisco Mammography Registry, one of the sites of the NCI-funded Breast Cancer Screening Consortium (U01CA063740). CPMC is a community hospital in San Francisco, which has one of the highest volumes for mammography in San Francisco. Between September 2004 and June 2007, >90,000 mammograms were performed at CPMC. The CPMC breast health cohort collects demographic and risk factor data on women receiving mammography through participation in the San Francisco Mammography Registry, as part of the Breast Cancer Screening Consortium (U01CA063740). The SFMR database collects information from all sources, including a questionnaire on demographic and risk factor information, the clinical results of the breast examination, the measures of breast density by Dr. John Shepherd and the women who agreed to donate a blood sample. By merging these various sources of information we have very efficiently developed a large sample of women who have donated blood and have had a measure of mamographic density.  _Blood Collection_: Dr. Steve Cummings is leading an effort to collect and archive blood samples from women who are receiving mammography screening. All women who are sent for a screening mammogram at CPMC are considered eligible. Since the cohort began collecting blood samples in July 2004 until June 2007, samples have been collected from over 11,000 women.  _Measurement of Breast Density_: Dr. John Shepherd is currently measuring breast density in a large fraction of the cohort using an automated approach with single X-ray absorptiometry. Dr. Shepherd has established a link with the CPMC mammography center that allows him to collect routine digital mammography information. Using the data from the mammogram, Dr. Shepherd and his group have developed the single X-ray absorptiometry (SXA) technique for measuring density which is described in more detail below.  The table demonstrates the distribution of demographic variables and some breast cancer risk factors of women who donated blood and had a breast density measurement in the CPMC breast health cohort. Nearly 80% of the participants are Caucasian and most of the women are post-menopausal with a median age of ~52. Since it will be difficult to accrue a large enough sample from each ethnic group, our study will focus only on Caucasian women.  **Table**: Demographic variables, reproductive history and family history of breast cancer among 2962 women participating in the CPMC cohort study who contributed blood samples between 1994-1997.

SXA measurement of breast density is done on approximately 30% of all screening mammograms. Below we describe the method for measurement of breast density by SXA by Dr. Shepherd's group and its validation and association with breast cancer. As we demonstrate below, breast density, as measured by SXA, is an automated, highly reproducible measure of the density of breast tissue and is associated with breast cancer risk.  _SXA for Quantifying Breast Density_: Single x-ray absorptiometry (SXA) was initially developed for measuring bone density. SXA can determine the fraction of each of two densities simultaneously using the fact the sample is a constant thickness, the thickness in known, and the total attenuation is known. In applying this technique to breast density, we assume a two compartment model: fat and non-fatty (fibroglandular tissue). We use a reference material composed of various concentrations of two materials: one which is the same density as fat and another which is the same density as fibroglandular tissue. The reference material (phantom) is placed in the X-ray field with each mammogram. We have been able to implement this in a way that is unintrusive to the patient and technologist at CPMC.  Assuming this two-compartment model and a constant known breast thickness, we can then calculate the percent density at any region of the breast based on the assumption that % pixel grey-scale is proportion to the mass fractions of breast fat and lean tissue. If reference materials (a phantom) of fat and fibroglandular tissue are imaged with the patient's breast and the reference materials have the same thickness as the patient's breast, then the breast's grey-scale values can be converted to fat/fibroglandular mass fractions by interpolating between those two references. The total percent density is found by averaging the volume fraction over all breast pixels.  The phantom being used for breast density assessment at CPMC began to be used in September 2004. The phantom does not have to be manipulated by the technologist and stays attached on the mammography device during standard craniocaudal (CC) views. Thus it creates minimal to no interference with the clinical mammogram.  _Reproducibility of breast density measures_: Traditional measures of mammographic density require some human interpretation. A human reader outlines the area perceived to be dense and a computer then calculates the percent area outlined as a percent of the entire image. Thus, while traditional mammographic density is associated with breast cancer risk, it has some limitations. In a study by Drs. Shepherd, Kerlikowske, et al., the correlation coefficient (Pearson's R) between different readers was 0.8-0.9.  In contrast to the traditional mammographic density measurement, the SXA measurement is fully automated and, therefore, the reproducibility of the measurement is higher. Dr. Shepherd and colleagues have performed a replication study of SXA as a measurement of breast density. They have estimated the correlation coefficient of the SXA measurement of breast density to be >0.98. Thus, as expected for an automated measure, SXA is a highly reproducible measure of mammographic breast density.  Drs. Shepherd and Kerlikowske have recently analyzed the association between breast cancer risk and breast density as measured by SXA (Shepherd et al., Cancer Epi Biomarkers and Prev, 2011, PMID: [21610220][1]). They found that women in the highest quintile of % volumetric density had an odds ratio of 4.1 (95% CI: 2.3 - 7.2) for breast cancer risk compared to women in the lowest quintile of volumetric density. Thus volumetric density appears to be a highly reproducible, automated measure of breast cancer.    * Study Type: Nested Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 982  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21610220  :::Nested Case-Control::: 982:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

To derive we begin with the % breast density as measured by SXA (described in the citations). For the sake of this study we used % density as opposed to total volumetric density. We then took the square-root transformed SXA % density (to make the distribution approximately normal). We then created a linear regression model between age, BMI and transformed breast density. We then took the residual of the linear model, as the age and BMI- adjusted breast density. The top and bottom quintiles of this measurement were used.  Age and BMI-adjusted measures are used since these are both felt to be "nuisance variables" that affect density greatly but negatively confound the association with breast cancer. Other non-genetic factors that affect breast density (parity history) only modestly affect breast density so their effect was not eliminated when creating the sampling approach.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Elad Ziv, MD.

The study is sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and six other institutes, centers, and offices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  The population of 16,000 persons of Hispanic/Latino origin, specifically Cuban, Puerto Rican, Mexican, and Central/South American, was recruited through four Field Centers affiliated with San Diego State University, Northwestern University in Chicago, Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx area of New York, and the University of Miami. Seven additional academic centers serve as scientific and logistical support centers.  Study participants aged 18-74 years completed an extensive clinic exam and assessments to determine baseline risk factors. Annual follow-up interviews are conducted to determine health outcomes of interest. Study results are disseminated through scientific journals and also conveyed to the communities involved in the study in order to improve public health at the local level.  12,400 subjects that have individual level data will be available soon.    * Study Weblinks: [Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE)][1]; [Hispanic Community Health Study][2]    * Study Types: Longitudinal, Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access:  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.pagestudy.org     [2]: http://www.cscc.unc.edu/hchs  :::Longitudinal, Cohort:::0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Estimated availability to be determined  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   Included were self-identified Hispanic/Latino men and women ages 18-74 years, resident in pre-defined geographic areas.  :::iSelect Custom Panel:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Cardiovascular Diseases ][1]    * [ Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 ][2]    * [ Obesity ][3]    * [ Cholesterol, HDL ][4]    * [ Cholesterol, LDL ][5]    * [ Coronary Disease ][6]    * [ Triglycerides ][7]    * [ Myocardial Infarction ][8]    * [ C-Reactive Protein ][9]    * [ Asthma ][10]    * [ Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive ][11]    * [ Kidney ][12]    * [ Spirometry ][13]    * [ Hearing ][14]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68002318[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68003924[uid]     [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68009765[uid]     [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68008076[uid]     [5]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68008078[uid]     [6]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68003327[uid]     [7]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68014280[uid]     [8]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68009203[uid]     [9]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68002097[uid]     [10]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&ter m=68001249[uid]     [11]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&ter m=68029424[uid]     [12]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&ter m=68007668[uid]     [13]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&ter m=68013147[uid]     [14]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&ter m=68006309[uid]  :::Study History   At each of 4 field sites (Miami, FL, Bronx, NY, Chicago, IL, San Diego, CA) 4,000 self-identified Hispanic/Latino men and women ages 18-74 years were recruited and examined.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Gerardo Heiss.

phs000225.v1.p1::: A Population Genomics Study Using a Disease-Targeted Cell model: Integration  	   of <i>cis</i>-eQTLs Discovered in Human Primary Osteoblasts with GWAS of Bone Phenotypes:::Study Description   The common genetic variants associated with complex traits typically lie in non-coding DNA and may alter gene regulation in a cell type-specific manner. Consequently, the choice of tissue or cell model in the dissection of disease associations is important. We carried out an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) study of primary human osteoblasts (HOb) derived from 95 unrelated donors of Swedish origin, each represented by two independently derived primary lines to provide biological replication. We combined our data with publicly available information from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of bone mineral density (BMD). The top 2000 BMD-associated SNPs were tested for cis-association of gene expression in HObs and in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) using publicly available data and showed that HObs have a significantly greater enrichment (threefold) of converging cis-eQTLs as compared to LCLs. The top 10 BMD loci with SNPs showing strong cis-effects on gene expression in HObs were selected for further validation using a staged design in two cohorts of Caucasian male subjects. All 10 variants were tested in the Swedish MrOS Cohort (n = 3014), providing evidence for two novel BMD loci (SRR and MSH3). These variants were then tested in the Rotterdam Study (n = 2090), yielding converging evidence for BMD association at the 17p13.3 SRR locus. The cis- regulatory effect was further fine-mapped to the proximal promoter of the SRR gene (rs3744270). Our results suggest that primary cells relevant to disease phenotypes complement traditional approaches for prioritization and validation of GWAS hits for follow-up studies.

phs000257.v2.p1::: Metagenomic Analysis of the Structure and Function of the Human Gut Microbiota in Crohn&#39;s Disease:::Study Description   Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's disease, are chronic, immunologically mediated disorders that have severe medical consequences. The current hypothesis is that these diseases are due to an overly aggressive immune response to a subset of commensal enteric bacteria. Studies to date on IBD have suggested that the disorder may be caused by a combination of bacteria and host susceptibility; however the etiologies of these diseases remain an enigma. In this application, we propose to develop and demonstrate the ability to profile Crohn's disease at an unprecedented molecular level by elucidation of specific biomarkers (bacterial strains, genes, or proteins) that correlate to disease symptoms. To achieve this goal, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach based on metagenomic and metaproteomic molecular tools to elucidate the composition of the commensal microbiota in monozygotic twins that are either healthy or exhibit Crohn's disease (for concordant, both are diseased; for discordant, one is healthy and one is diseased). The central hypotheses of this proposal are (1) that specific members and/or functional activities of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota differ in patients with Crohn's disease as compared to healthy individuals, and (2) that it will be possible to elucidate microbial signatures which correlate with the occurrence and progression of this disease by integration of data obtained from 16S rRNA- based molecular fingerprinting, metagenomics, and metaproteomics approaches. To address these hypotheses, three specific aims are proposed: 1) Obtain data on community gene content (metagenome) in a subset of healthy twins and twins with Crohn's Disease to assess potential differences in the metabolic capabilities of the gut microbiota associated with CD, 2) Obtain data on community protein content (metaproteome) in a subset of healthy twins and twins with Crohn's Disease to assess the state of expressed proteins associated with CD, 3) Apply various statistical clustering and classification methods to correlate/associate microbial community composition, gene and protein content with patient metadata, including metabolite profiles and clinical phenotype. The ultimate goal of these efforts is to identify novel biomarkers for non-invasive diagnostics of CD and to eventually identify drug targets (i.e. bacterial strains) for cure or suppression of disease symptoms. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to unravel the contribution of the bacteria that normally inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract to Crohn's disease by using a multidisciplinary approach to study changes in the structure and function of gut microbial communities in three sets of patient cohorts who have Crohn's disease. These results will be compared with those obtained from the study of healthy individuals and have the potential to identify new biomarkers of disease severity, location, and progression.    * Study Type: Twin    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 24  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Twin::: 24:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

IBD can be divided into two categories: Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD). Both are chronic, relapsing, immunologically mediated disorders that can have severe physical consequences. This study describes research that will combine state-of-the-art experimental and computational methods to characterize variation in the gut microbiota in CD at a level never before possible. At the present, there are virtually no other reports that have addressed the complex aspects of this severe disease by studying both microbial community structure and function. A microbial involvement in the etiology of CD has been suggested, characterized, in part, by an imbalance between beneficial and detrimental bacteria in the intestine microbiota between healthy individuals and CD patients. Given that we do not currently understand whether changes in the types and/ or abundance of microbial community members, or changes in gene content, or changes in level of expressed protein (or some combination of the three) are most relevant to the etiology of CD, we believe it is essential to take a more holistic view of this question and examine microbial community structure and function.  Version 2 of this study was created so that new subjects and sample data could be added.

A previously healthy Caucasian female in her late 50s presented with a sudden onset of sore throat and easy bruisability. There was no antecedent history of prior cancer, or administration of cytotoxic drugs and/or radiation therapy. The patient's family history was obtained by a trained genetic counselor and was positive for late onset cancers in her mother and several of her mother's siblings, including a maternal uncle with a reported case of AML that was confirmed by death certificate. The patient's sister has Essential Thrombocythemia (JAK2 V617F negative). None of the patient's children had a history of cancer. The patient's pedigree is being withheld from this report to protect the privacy of the family. The patient was found to have a peripheral blood white blood cell count of 105,000 cells per microliter with 85% blasts on presentation. The hemoglobin was 12.1 grams per deciliter, and platelet count was 20,000 per microliter. A bone marrow biopsy and aspirate revealed 100% blasts, and confirmed the diagnosis of AML, FAB M1 subtype. Flow cytometry revealed a single population of myeloblasts with cell surface expression of CD-13, -33 and -117, and absent expression of CD-34 and HLA-DR. Cytogenetic analysis of tumor cells revealed a normal 46 XX karyotype. After informed consent was obtained, she was enrolled in a cooperative group protocol for treatment of AML in adults less than age 60 (Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) #19808), and a Washington University Human Studies Committee-approved protocol for tissue banking in patients with MDS and AML (HSC #01-1014). Specimens of bone marrow, peripheral blood, and skin were collected and cryopreserved for genomic studies. After emergent leukopheresis, she underwent induction chemotherapy with cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide. A bone marrow biopsy repeated 2 weeks later demonstrated chemoablation. After myeloid recovery, a repeat bone marrow biopsy demonstrated first complete remission. On the basis of her intermediate risk cytogenetics, she was assigned to undergo consolidation chemotherapy with high dose cytarabine and etoposide, followed by filgrastim to facilitate autologous hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and collection. She subsequently underwent dose-intensive busulfan and etoposide conditioning, followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue. Upon recovery from autologous stem cell transplantation, she was assigned to receive maintenance immunotherapy with IL-2. Despite these multiple therapies, she relapsed 11 months after her initial diagnosis. After failing to respond to a salvage regimen of mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine, she received fludarabine, high dose Ara-C, idarubicin and gemtuzumab ozogamicin. 10 days later she received high dose cyclophosphamide conditioning (60 mg/kg daily x 2) and then single dose total body irradiation (550 cGy; 30 cGy/min) followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling donor. A bone marrow biopsy performed one month after transplantation confirmed second complete remission. Unfortunately, her disease relapsed four months later. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was again administered, followed by two donor lymphocyte infusions, without clearance of circulating blasts. She was then successively treated with azacytidine, low dose cytarabine, and decitabine, again without appreciable response, and expired 24 months after her initial diagnosis. Informed consent for whole genome sequencing was subsequently obtained from her next of kin and family members, using a revised Washington University Human Studies Committee- approved protocol that specifically addresses privacy and confidentiality issues associated with whole genome sequencing (HSC #01-1014, Amendment #17).  Case presentation of UPN 807970. A 38-year-old Caucasian male who was previously in good health presented with fatigue and a cough. The white blood cell count was 39,800/ul with 97% blasts, the hemoglobin was 8.9 g/dl, and the platelet count was 35,000/ul. A bone marrow examination revealed 90% cellularity and 86% myeloperoxidase positive blasts. Flow cytometric analysis of the bone marrow sample revealed a uniform population of cells in the blast gate that stained for CD33 and CD117, but not CD13, CD14, CD34, or HLA-DR. Routine cytogenetics of the bone marrow samples revealed a normal 46 XY karyotype. The bone marrow and skin samples were banked with informed consent for whole genome sequencing on a protocol approved by the Washington University Institutional Review Board. The patient's Unique Patient Number (UPN) on the protocol was 807970. There was no family history of leukemia. The patient's mother developed breast cancer at age 60, and non-Hodgkins lymphoma at age 63; her half sister developed breast cancer at age 50. The patient was treated initially with a 7-day course of infusional cytarabine, and three days of daunorubicin. He obtained a morphologic complete remission and count recovery within 5 weeks. The patient was consolidated with high-dose cytarabine for four cycles, and has had no further therapy. He remains in complete remission 3 years later.  Case presentation of UPN 189941. A 37 year-old female presented with Stage 2 estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, Her2-positive breast cancer and was treated with surgery, local radiotherapy and chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin). At age 39, she was diagnosed with Stage IIIC ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (FIGO grade III), and she was treated with surgery and chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel). Her ovarian cancer recurred at age 42, and she received additional chemotherapy. Six months later, she presented with t-AML. Analysis of her bone marrow revealed 76% blasts with monocytic features and a complex karyotype involving monosomy 7, del(5q), and two marker chromosomes that could not be resolved by standard cytogenetic analysis. She developed respiratory failure and died 8 days after presentation. Of note, her family history did not suggest an inherited cancer susceptibility syndrome. Specifically, no cancers were reported in 6 first degree relatives (parents, brother, and 3 children) and only a single case of cancer (leg sarcoma at age 62 in a maternal grandfather) was reported in 10 second degree relatives. Nonetheless, the early onset of both breast and ovarian cancer prompted commercial testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, which was negative.  Case presentation of UPN 757128. We used massively parallel sequencing technology to sequence the genomic DNA of tumor and normal skin cells obtained from a patient with a typical clinical presentation of acute promyelocytic leukemia, who had no evidence of the classic t(15;17) translocation, but presented with pancytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and increased bone marrow promyelocytes. She was treated with standard induction therapy using cytarabine and idarubicin, but had persistent bone marrow leukemia at day 14. She entered a complete remission following reinduction with cytarabine, idarubicin and etoposide. She was empirically consolidated with arsenic trioxide. As a result of the whole genome sequencing results, she was further treated with all-trans retinoic acid maintenance therapy and remains in remission 15 months after presentation.  Case presentation of UPN 461282. A 65 year old male with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) received supportive care only (erythropoietin, RBC transfusion) until MDS banking on day 1077 after initial diagnosis. He had a complex karyotype at MDS banking consisting of: -17,del(20)(q11.2),r[5]/idem,del(5)(q31q33)[10]/idem,del(5)(q13q33)[3]/ idem,-X,add(X)(q22),der(12)t(12;?)del(12)(q22)[2]. He then received 11 cycles of decitabine, followed by 3 cycles of lenalidomide. On day 1755 (day 660 after MDS banking) he progressed to sAML. At sAML banking his karyotype showed: del(5)(q22q33),-17,del(20(q11.2)[14]. He then underwent standard induction ("7+3"), followed by salvage chemotherapy (fludarabine, high dose cytarabine, and filgrastim) for induction failure. He then proceeded to a matched, unrelated stem cell transplant with fludarabine/busulfan/thymoglobulin conditioning. He had evidence of persistent disease at day+30 following transplant, received two cycles of decitabine, and died of progressive leukemia on day 2009 (day 932 after MDS banking). The patient's past medical history was notable for basal cell carcinoma, localized prostate cancer, a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, all treated surgically without adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. A sister and two nieces had early onset breast cancer (age<40). One niece also had a neuroendocrine tumor and clinical testing revealed an inherited deleterious TP53 variant.  Case presentation of UPN 667720. A 66 year old female with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) was treated initially with supportive care (erythropoietin and RBC transfusions) until MDS banking on day 8, followed by four cycles of decitabine. She was then observed until sAML progression at day 667 (day 659 after MDS banking). Her karyotype was normal at MDS and sAML banking. She received one further cycle of decitabine, followed by supportive care until her death on day 724 (day 716 after MDS banking).  Case presentation of UPN 610184. A 45 year old female with refractory anemia (RA) was observed for one year, then received 3 cycles of lenalidomide prior to MDS banking on day 162 after diagnosis. She had a complex karyotype at MDS banking consisting of: add(1)(p36.3),del(5)(q13q33),-13,dic(16;21)(p13.3;q11.2),add(17)(p13),-18,-22. She received no further therapy until progression to sAML on day 314 (day 152 after MDS banking). Her karyotype at sAML banking showed: add(1)(p36.3),del(5) (q13q33),-7,-13,dic(16;21)(p13.3;p11.2),add(17)(p13),-18,-22,+mar[cp17]. She then underwent standard induction chemotherapy ("7+3"), followed by salvage chemotherapy (mitoxantrone, etoposide, cytarabine) for induction failure. On day 398 (day 236 after MDS banking), she underwent a matched, unrelated donor transplant, relapsed, and died of progressive disease on day 589 (day 427 after MDS banking).  Case presentation of UPN 182896. A 75 year old male with refractory anemia (RA) was observed until MDS banking on day 69 after diagnosis. His karyotype at MDS banking showed: +8 [6]. He then received supportive care only (RBC transfusion) until sAML progression on day 1047 (day 978 after MDS banking). His karyotype at sAML banking showed: +3, +8, +9, -12, +15, +19, +22 [cp11]. He then received 5 cycles of decitabine and intermittent hydroxyurea until he died from progressive disease on day 1205 (day 1136 after MDS banking).  Case presentation of UPN 266395. A 65 year old male with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) treated with supportive care (erythropoietin, RBC transfusion) until MDS banking on day 46 after initial diagnosis. He received one month of hydroxyurea before sAML progression on day 76 (day 30 after MDS banking). His karyotype was normal at MDS and sAML banking. He required emergency leukopheresis, followed by 5-azacytidine for 6 cycles. He then developed CNS leukemia and received supportive care only until his death on day 321 after diagnosis (day 275 after MDS banking).  Case presentation of UPN 288033. A 31 year old female with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) at diagnosis and MDS banking was observed until sAML progression on day 28. Her karyotype was normal at MDS and sAML banking. She underwent induction chemotherapy (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide), followed by reinduction and salvage chemotherapy Page 2 of 100 before proceeding to a matched, unrelated donor transplant. She died of graft-versus- host disease on day 367 (day 367 after MDS diagnosis).  Case presentation of UPN 298273. A 27 year old male with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) at diagnosis and MDS banking received 3 cycles of an oral angiogenesis inhibitor (Vatalanib) on a clinical trial until sAML progression on day 131. His karyotype was normal at MDS and sAML banking. He then received one cycle of 5-azacytidine, followed by a matched, unrelated donor transplant. He relapsed on day 257 and received salvage chemotherapy, but died of graft-versus-host disease on day 540 (day 514 after MDS banking).  Case presentation of UPN 400220. A 34 year old Caucasian female with a prior history of cervical carcinoma in situ (treated with LEEP procedure), mitral valve prolapse, and endometriosis, presented with fatigue, allergy symptoms and chest pain. A CBC demonstrated WBC 14,500 cells/mcl, hemoglobin 11.5 g/dl, platelets 139,000 cells/mcl, with 58% circulating blasts. A bone marrow biopsy demonstrated 90% cellularity, with 71% myeloblasts (MPX +, NSE -, CD13/33/34/117/HLA-DR+), consistent with a diagnosis of AML M4. Cytogenetics showed a 46 XX karyotype. Molecular diagnostic studies demonstrated a FLT3 internal tandem duplication. Initial therapy consisted of 7 +3 induction regimen with infusional cytarabine and idarubicin. A mid-cycle bone marrow biopsy revealed ablation, and a subsequent biopsy documented first complete remission. Post-remission therapy consisted of 3 cycles of high dose cytarabine. Relapse was documented 8 months after initial diagnosis. The patient underwent salvage chemotherapy with mitoxantrone, etoposide, and high dose cytarabine (MEC) with concurrent plerixafor, but did not achieve remission. She was subsequently treated with fludarabine, high dose cytarabine, idarubicin, and gemtuzumab with concurrent filgrastim, and subsequently underwent matched unrelated donor stem cell transplantation with active disease. She expired at day +7 post transplant, 10 months from initial diagnosis.  Case presentation of UPN 426980.

Initial therapy consisted of 7 + 3 + 3 induction with infusional cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide. A mid-cycle bone marrow biopsy was ablated, and a subsequent biopsy following marrow recovery documented first complete remission. Post-remission therapy consisted of high dose cytarabine and etoposide, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation with busulfan/cyclophosphamide conditioning. Relapse was documented seven months from diagnosis, and treated with fludarabine, high dose cytarabine, idarubicin, and gemtuzumab with concurrent filgrastim, resulting in second complete remission. He subsequently underwent matched sibling donor allogeneic stem cell transplant 12 months from initial diagnosis, but relapsed two months later. Subsequent treatment included: clofarabine and high dose cytarabine; decitabine; and cladribine, high dose cytarabine, and imatinib, as well as serial donor lymphocyte infusions, without achieving remission. He expired from progressive disease 19 months from initial diagnosis.  Case presentation of UPN 758168. A previously healthy 25 year old Caucasian female presented with fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and decreased visual acuity in her left eye. A CBC demonstrated WBC 3,500 cells/mcl, hemoglobin 5.9 g/dl, platelets 24,000 cells/mcl, with circulating promyelocytes. Diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) was present (INR of 3.2 and fibrinogen 88 mg/dl). A bone marrow biopsy demonstrated hypercellularity, with 93% promyelocytes (MPX +, NSE -, CD13/33+), consistent with a diagnosis of AML M3. Cytogenetics showed a t(15;17) translocation. Ophthalmologic evaluation demonstrated retinal hemorrhage, detachment, and acute glaucoma, resulting in irreversible loss of vision and eventual enucleation. Initial therapy consisted of 7 + 3 induction with infusional cytarabine, idarubicin, and concurrent ATRA, complicated by headaches attributed to pseudotumor cerebri (CSF negative for malignancy). A bone marrow biopsy following marrow recovery documented first complete remission. Following induction, additional ATRA was withheld because it was presumed to be the cause of her pseudotumor cerebri. Post-remission therapy consisted of 3 cycles of "anthracycline" administered by the referring oncologist, followed by planned arsenic trioxide maintenance (prematurely aborted due to noncompliance). Relapse was documented 32 months from diagnosis, and was treated with arsenic trioxide, resulting in second complete remission.

A mid-cycle bone marrow biopsy revealed ablation, and a subsequent biopsy following marrow recovery documented first complete remission. Post-remission therapy consisted of 2 cycles of high dose cytarabine. Relapse was documented 8 months from diagnosis, and was treated with mitoxantrone, etoposide, and high dose cytarabine with concurrent plerixafor, following which residual disease was documented (5-7% blasts). He subsequently underwent matched sibling donor allogeneic stem cell transplant following conditioning with single dose total body irradiation and high dose cyclophosphamide, but relapsed 1 month post transplant. Subsequent salvage therapy included decitabine, which yielded a third remission. He subsequently developed extramedullary relapse that was treated with radiation, and died of progressive disease 30 months from initial diagnosis.  Case presentation of UPN 123172 (AML3). 56 year old Caucasian male with a remote history of rheumatic heart disease and aortic valve replacement, presented with a one month history of unexplained fever, night sweats, and 12 pound weight loss.

Initial therapy consisted of 7 + 3 + 3 induction with infusional cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide. A mid-cycle bone marrow biopsy showed <10% cellularity, but was suggestive of persistent leukemia with 18% residual blasts. A subsequent biopsy following marrow recovery clearly documented persistent disease, and he was treated with a salvage regimen of mitoxantrone, etoposide, and high dose cytarabine, following which complete remission was achieved. He subsequently underwent matched unrelated donor stem cell transplantation in CR1 following fractionated total body irradiation/cyclophosphamide conditioning, five months after initial diagnosis. Relapse was documented at three months post transplant, and he underwent salvage chemotherapy with fludarabine, high dose cytarabine, and idarubicin, following which a second complete remission was achieved. He subsequently three serial donor lymphocyte infusions, and remained in remission for over a year before relapsing again, 24 months from his initial diagnosis. He was treated with a salvage regimen of clofarabine and high dose cytarabine, following which a third complete remission was achieved. He subsequently underwent a second matched unrelated donor transplant (from a different donor), but died from infectious complications prior to count recovery, 27 months from initial diagnosis.

A bone marrow biopsy demonstrated >90% cellularity, with 80% promyelocytes and myeloblasts (MPX +, NSE -, CD13/33+, CD34/HLA-DR-), consistent with a diagnosis of AML M3. Cytogenetics showed a 47 XY karyotype, with a t(15;17) translocation, trisomy 8, and del 7q. There was no evidence of diffuse intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) at presentation. Initial therapy consisted of 7 + 3 + 3 induction with infusional cytarabine, daunorubicin, and concurrent ATRA. A bone marrow biopsy following count recovery documented first complete remission, with FISH studies negative but RT-PCR positive for PML/RAR. Post- remission therapy consisted of two cycles of idarubicin and one cycle of etoposide, each with concurrent ATRA, followed by two years of ATRA, methotrexate, and 6-mercaptopurine maintenance.

Case presentation of UPN 709968 (AML9). 25 year old Caucasian male, with a history of depression, presented with a one week history of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, cough, and a new diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis. A CBC demonstrated: WBC 8200 cells/mcl, hemoglobin 9.9 g/dl, platelets 18,000 cells/mcl, with 63% circulating promyelocytes and blasts. Diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) was present with an INR of 1.68 and fibrinogen 130 mg/dl. A bone marrow biopsy demonstrated 100% cellularity, with 91% promyelocytes and myeloblasts (MPX +, NSE -, CD13/117+, CD33/34/HLA-DR-), consistent with a diagnosis of AML M3. Cytogenetics showed a 46 XY karyotype, with a t(15;17) translocation. Initial therapy consisted of 7 + 3 induction with infusional cytarabine, daunorubicin, and concurrent ATRA. A bone marrow biopsy following count recovery showed a hypercellular marrow with 6% blasts and 59% PML/RAR positivity by FISH. He was continued on ATRA for an additional 4 weeks, and repeat bone marrow demonstrated hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular remission. Post-remission therapy consisted of three cycles of daunorubicin with concurrent ATRA, followed by a planned two year course of ATRA, methotrexate, and 6-mercaptopurine. Autologous stem cells were harvested after 12 months on maintenance therapy, and relapse was documented six months later (24 months from initial diagnosis). He was reinduced to complete remission with arsenic and gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and subsequently underwent matched unrelated donor stem cell transplantation following busulfan/cyclophosphamide conditioning. His transplant was complicated by steroid-refractory grade 4 acute GI graft vs host disease (GVHD), for which autologous stem cells were reinfused ultimately following reconditioning with fludarabine and low dose total body irradiation, following which his GVHD resolved and he reverted to 100% recipient engraftment. He did well with no further therapy for 22 months until relapsing a second time (55 months from initial diagnosis), and was treated with arsenic and ATRA, again achieving a third complete remission prior to proceeding to a second matched unrelated donor transplant from a different donor following single dose total body irradiation/cyclophosphamide condiditoning.

phs000182.v2.p1::: Age related Macular Degeneration (AMD)-- Michigan, Mayo, AREDS, Pennsylvania (MMAP) Cohort Study: A Joint Genome Wide Association Study:::Study Description   Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of incurable blindness in people over the age of 65. AMD is a late-onset multi-factorial neurodegenerative disease and its pathogenesis involves interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Several chromosomal regions have been associated with AMD susceptibility through linkage analysis ([Swaroop et al., 2009][1]). More recent studies provide strong evidence that variants within the CFH gene cluster on chromosome 1 and at/near LOC387715/ARMS2 on chromosome 10 are strongly associated with disease. Variants at other genes including C2/BF, C3, CFI and APOE4, also contribute to AMD susceptibility.  Our primary goals are to identify genetic variants and haplotypes that are associated with AMD. The underlying hypothesis is that DNA variation(s) in multiple genetic susceptibility loci will predispose individuals to AMD pathogenesis, and comparison of DNA of cases and controls should identify these susceptibility variants. Our studies are focused on the genetic analysis of advanced AMD and should provide novel insights into disease diagnosis, progression and pathology.  We have assembled a collaborative group of researchers from the University of Michigan, Mayo Clinic, University of Pennsylvania, and the AREDS group including National Eye Institute intramural investigators, who collected clinical data and DNA from a large number of patients affected with AMD and from unaffected controls. The primary source of funding was National Eye Institute. Through this collaborative effort, we submitted and obtained usable genotyping data on 2184 patients and 1155 controls from the Center for Inherited Disease Research ([CIDR][2]).    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 3340  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19405847     [2]: http://www.cidr.jhmi.edu/  :::Case-Control::: 3340:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Affected patients were enrolled primarily from the retina clinic of the Kellogg Eye Center with the help of clinicians and staff. The control participants were enrolled primarily from the general ophthalmology clinics of the Kellogg Eye Center. After the enrollment of affected probands, we sought to enroll affected and unaffected family members. To date, more than 2300 affected and unaffected subjects have been enrolled in the study.  The University of Michigan genetic studies of AMD have resulted in several peer-reviewed manuscripts, notably a whole-genome linkage scan for age-related macular degeneration ([Abecasis et al., 2004][1]) and a joint-analysis of several linkage scans ([Fisher et al., 2005][2]), a dissection of the roles of complement factor H ([Zareparsi et al., 2005a][3]) and TLR4 ([Zareparsi et al., 2005b][4]), and recent detailed analysis of the complement factor H locus ([Li et al., 2006][5]) and LOC387715/ARMS2 locus ([Kanda et al., 2007][6]) among others.  For the University of Pennsylvania cohort, subjects were ascertained through the ophthalmology practices of the University of Pennsylvania (Dr. Dwight Stambolian and colleagues) as well as subjects who participated in the clinical trial of the CAPT study.  The Mayo subjects were enrolled from the practices of Dr. Albert Edwards and selected colleagues from Dallas, TX and Rochester, MN starting in 1998. The subjects have been used in a number of studies and contributed to one of the initial reports of association between macular degeneration and the CFH locus ([Edwards et al., 2005,][7], [2008][8], [2009][9]; [Park et al., 2009][10]).

phs000387.v1.p1::: eMERGE Geisinger eGenomic Medicine (GeM) Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Project (AAAP):::Study Description   ** Important Links and Information **    * [Data Use Certification Agreement][1]    * [Apply for Authorized Access ][2]    * [Acknowledgement Statements][3]  A large research cohort of Geisinger Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) patients was created by enrolling and consenting patients of the Geisinger Department of Vascular Surgery. Consented patients provide blood, serum and DNA samples for research and authorize use of data in their medical record for research. They also complete a data questionnaire that asks information about family history of AAA and other vascular diseases, as well as information on known or suspected AAA risk factors, including smoking history, body mass index, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerotic disease. The AAA cases are 78% male, with a mean age of 74 years; 39% have undergone surgical or endovascular repair; more than 85% or current or past smokers; approximately 20% of cases report a positive family history of AAA. Geisinger AAA patients undergo regular imaging studies, typically every 6 months, to monitor the progression of aneurysm expansion. This allows the growth rates of their aneurysm to be calculated.

phs000369.v1.p1::: Sequence Analysis of Mutations and Translocations Across Breast Cancer Subtypes:::Study Description   This study combined whole exome (103 samples) and whole genome (22 samples) sequencing over a total of 108 breast tumors and matched normal DNA to identify novel mutations and translocations. Samples were subjected to paired- end Illumina sequencing with goal of 30x coverage of tumor/normal for whole genomes and 100x tumor/normal coverage for whole exomes. From these sequences, we used various computational techniques to identify somatic point mutations, insertion/deletions and structural rearrangements in these tumors. From these data, we identified new insights into the rates of background mutations in these cancers, novel recurrent mutated genes, and multiple gene rearrangements. One of these rearrangements appears to be a recurrent event in breast cancer.    * Study Types: Case Set, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal, Exome Sequencing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 108  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal, Exome Sequencing::: 108:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000419.v1.p1::: A novel recurrent mutation in MITF predisposes to familial and sporadic melanoma:::Study Description   We conducted whole-genome sequencing of probands from several melanoma families, identifying one individual carrying a novel germline variant (c.G1075A, NM_000248.3; p.E318K, NP_000239.1; rs149617956) in the melanoma lineage-specific oncogene MITF. While the variant cosegregated with melanoma in some, but not all cases in the family, linkage analysis of 31 families subsequently identified to carry the variant generated a LOD score of 2.7 under a dominant model, suggesting E318K as a possible intermediate risk variant. Consistent with this, E318K was significantly associated with melanoma in a large Australian case-control sample, giving an odds ratio (OR) of 2.33, 95% CI 1.21-4.70 (case and control carrier frequency, 0.0165 and 0.0072, respectively; P=0.008). Likewise, it was similarly associated in an independent case-control sample from the United Kingdom (UK P=0.012; combined P=0.0003, OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.41-3.45). In the Australian sample, the variant allele was significantly over-represented in cases with a family history of melanoma (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.23-6.92), multiple primary melanomas (OR 4.22, 95% CI 1.52-10.91), or both (OR 8.37, 95% CI 2.58-23.80). The variant allele was also associated with increased nevus count (combined P=0.002, OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.42-4.55) and non-blue eye color (combined P=0.008, OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.11-3.81). Functional analysis of E318K showed that MITF encoded by the variant allele had impaired sumoylation and differentially regulated several MITF targets. These data indicate that MITF is a melanoma predisposition gene and highlights the utility of whole-genome sequencing to identify novel rare variants associated with disease susceptibility.    * Study Types: Family, Whole Genome Sequencing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Family, Whole Genome Sequencing::: 1:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000507.v1.p1::: NHLBI and NIDDK Sponsored GWAS in Benign Ethnic Neutropenia/Leukopenia (BEN) in African-Americans (age &gt;45 yrs old) from the REGARDS:::Study Description   Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a clinical condition more commonly observed in African-Americans. It is characterized by a relative reduction in neutrophil count by about 1000 cells per microliter, leading to a decrease in total leukocyte count by similar decrement. Previous reports of this condition showed that there was neither higher frequency nor increased severity of infections in affected individuals. Bone marrow examinations showed normal white cell maturation; and ex vivo culture of marrow cells showed low normal or slightly reduced number of myeloid colonies. Under physiologic stress, the increases in neutrophil and leukocyte counts of BEN individuals are slightly lower, compared to normal African-Americans or Caucasians. These clinical observations suggest that BEN results from a lower 'set point' for cell number in the marrow. Additionally, case reports of familial BEN, the persistence of BEN over many decades in the US, UK, and Africa, and the recent report of Duffy antigen and chemokine receptor (DARC) being associated with neutropenia, all suggest a strong genetic association to neutropenia/leukopenia. Our initial look into microarray analyses in a pilot trial of subjects showed that there were no significant differences in mRNA signals between BEN and normal subjects. Therefore, we are now proposing a larger study, utilizing Illumina Omni Express chips, to look for genetic associations. We have partnered with the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study (REGARDS), where nearly half of the cohort are African-Americans. This will be one of the few GWAS being performed in only African-Americans, and will provide valuable genetic information to link with neutropenia and possibly other conditions/diseases.  Genotyping was performed by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). Quality control of the genotypic and phenotypic data was performed through a collaboration between CIDR and the Genetics Coordinating Center, Department of Biostatistics at the University of Washington, which is funded by a federal contract supported by 14 NIH Institutes (HHSN268200782096C).    * Study Weblink: [REGARDS][1]    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1200  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.regardsstudy.org  :::Case-Control::: 1200:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000339.v2.p1::: Targeted MitoExome Sequencing of Mitochondrial OXPHOS Diseases (Massachusetts General Hospital):::Study Description   Human disorders of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) represent a devastating collection of inherited diseases. These disorders impact at least 1:5000 live births, and are characterized by multi-organ system involvement. They are characterized by remarkable locus heterogeneity, with mutations in the mtDNA as well as in over 77 nuclear genes identified to date. It is estimated that additional genes may be mutated in these disorders.  To discover the genetic causes of mitochondrial OXPHOS diseases, we performed targeted, deep sequencing of the entire mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) and the coding exons of over 1000 nuclear genes encoding the mitochondrial proteome. We applied this 'MitoExome' sequencing to 124 unrelated patients with a wide range of OXPHOS disease presentations from the Massachusetts General Hospital Mitochondrial Disorders Clinic.  The 2.3Mb targeted region was captured by hybrid selection and Illumina sequenced with paired 76bp reads. The total set of 1605 targeted nuclear genes included 1013 genes with strong evidence of mitochondrial localization from the MitoCarta database, 377 genes with weaker evidence of mitochondrial localization from the MitoP2 database and other sources, and 215 genes known to cause other inborn errors of metabolism. Approximately 88% of targeted bases were well-covered (>20X), with mean 200X coverage per targeted base.    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 134  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set::: 134:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000338.v1.p1::: National Institute on Aging (NIA) SardiNIA Study:::Study Description   Sardinia is the second largest island in the Mediterranean and constitutes a genetically isolated founder population. This population has aided in the identification of genes involved in several Mendelian disorders and is attractive for genetic studies due to its organization in long-established settlements that developed from an initial group of founder settlers (~1,000) thousands of years ago. The current study has recruited 6,148 Sardinians aged 14 and older, from a cluster of four towns in the Lanusei Valley in the Ogliastra region of the province of Nuoro. This sample corresponds to approximately 62% of the population eligible in the area for recruitment. Information collected during enrollment allowed the individuals to be organized into 711 complex pedigrees, each up to five generations deep, with an average kinship coefficient of 0.1628. All volunteers have been characterized for 98 quantitative traits. Traits include anthropomorphic measures, plasma and serum markers (including cholesterol and other markers of cardiovascular disease), and personality traits (using the five-factor model).  The main goal of the study is to examine phenotypic similarities between relatives that yield information on the overall contributions of genes to trait variability. Data given here provide p-values for 98 traits studied in 1,412 individuals, based on genotyping with the Affymetrix 500K chip and imputed markers using the HapMap population as a reference (N=2,259,179). Sharing this genome assessment data at high level of resolution for a variety of quantitative traits will be useful for other groups to validate newly observed associations and to investigate possible pleiotropic effects.  For ulterior information, and in particular for any individual genotype information, a formal request should be addressed to the Steering Committee, c/o David Schlessinger, Chief, Laboratory of Genetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, NIH Biomedical Research Center, 251 Bayview Blvd., Suite 100 Baltimore, MD 21224 USA and should include IRB approval of a detailed proposal, along with a signed statement guaranteeing that no attempt will be made to identify any individual participant.    * Study Weblink: [SardiNIA Project][1]    * Study Types: Family, Population    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 0  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://sardinia.nia.nih.gov  :::Family, Population::: 0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000280.v2.p1::: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Cohort:::Study Description   The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), is a prospective epidemiologic study conducted in four U.S. communities. The four communities are Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; the northwest suburbs of Minneapolis, MN; and Washington County, MD. ARIC is designed to investigate the etiology and natural history of atherosclerosis, the etiology of clinical atherosclerotic diseases, and variation in cardiovascular risk factors, medical care and disease by race, gender, location, and date.  ARIC includes two parts: the Cohort Component and the Community Surveillance Component. The Cohort Component began in 1987, and each ARIC field center randomly selected and recruited a cohort sample of approximately 4,000 individuals aged 45-64 from a defined population in their community. A total of 15,792 participants received an extensive examination, including medical, social, and demographic data. These participants were examined with the baseline visit occurring in 1987-89, the second visit in 1990-92, the third visit in 1993-95, the fourth visit in 1996-98, and the fifth visit in 2011-13. Follow-up occurs yearly by telephone to maintain contact with participants and to assess health status of the cohort.  In the Community Surveillance Component, currently ongoing, these four communities are investigated to determine the community-wide occurrence of hospitalized myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease deaths in men and women aged 35-84 years. Hospitalized stroke is investigated in cohort participants only.

phs000439.v1.p1::: A Genome-Wide Association Comparative Analysis of Response of AF Patients to Rate Control Therapy; A Collaboration between the NIH Pharmacogenomics Research Network and the RIKEN Yokohama Institute Center for Genomic Medicine:::Study Description   The goal of this study was to identify genetic predictors of response to rate control therapy in patients with AF. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) focusing on subjects with a history of atrial fibrillation. Rate control therapy for AF uses a range of drugs (beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digitalis) to depress conduction through the AV node, thereby preventing rapid rates and minimizing symptoms. In large groups of patients, such as the Vanderbilt AF Registry (a clinical and genetic repository with over 1200 patients with ECG-confirmed AF) from which these study subjects were drawn, approximately 5% display failure of aggressive AV nodal-blocking therapy to control ventricular rate. In these patients, interruption of the AV node by ablation and pacemaker implantation are necessary for adequate rate control.  Study cases were individuals who underwent AV node ablation and pacemaker implantation after combined therapy with 3 AV nodal-blocking agents was ineffective in rate control. Controls for this study were individuals who met standardized rate-control efficacy criteria (as described in AFFIRM study, Wyse et al, NEJM 2002; PMID: [12466506][1]) for optimal rate control with 2 or fewer AV nodal-blocking agents. Two additional groups were genotyped by RIKEN: An additional group of patients with AF as well as subjects undergoing cardiac surgery in whom AF did not occur post-operatively. All study participants were recruited and treated/evaluated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.  This study was conducted by the Pharmacogenomics of Arrhythmia Therapy subgroup of the Pharmacogenetics Research Network, a nationwide collaboration of scientists studying the genetic contributions to drug response variability. Genotyping was performed by the RIKEN research institute in Japan using the Illumina 610 Quad Beadchip platform.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1888  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12466506  :::Case-Control::: 1888:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000439  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   Inclusion criteria for all AF subjects: Must be between 18 and 100 years old with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Additionally, subject must have a family member with known AF.  Exclusion criteria for all AF subjects: New onset AF occurring within 3 months of CABG or valve surgery; AF occurring post heart transplant; Post allogeneic bone marrow transplant.  Controls were defined as those subjects who satisfied the following criteria (AFFIRM) after treatment with 2 or fewer AV nodal-blocking agents: average heart rate (HR)  80 bpm at rest, in addition to either an average 24-hour HR  100 bpm and no maximal 24-hr HR > 110% of the predicted age-adjusted maximum exercise HR, or a HR  110 bpm during a 6-minute walk test.  Cases were defined as those subjects who failed to satisfy the AFFIRM criteria after combined therapy with 3 AV nodal-blocking agents and required AV node ablation and pacemaker implantation.  Criteria for post-op patients with no AF: All adult patients scheduled for elective cardiothoracic surgery who are capable of providing informed consent will be eligible for the study. Emergency patients or hemodynamically unstable patients for whom discussion of consent would delay surgery or who are incapable of providing consent will be excluded.  :::Human610_Quadv1_B:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Atrial Fibrillation ][1]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68001281[uid]  ::: :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Dawood Darbar, MD, PhD.

phs000236.v1.p1::: Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE): Causal Variants Across the Life Course (CALiCo): Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA):::Study Description   **CALiCo CARDIA**  > The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study is a study examining how heart disease develops in adults. It began in 1986 with a group of 5115 black and white men and women aged 18-30 years. The participants were selected so that there would be approximately the same number of people in subgroups of race, gender, education (high school or less and more than high school) and age (18-24 and 25-30) in Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN; and Oakland, CA. These same participants were asked to participate in follow-up examinations during 1987-1988 (Year 2), 1990-1991 (Year 5), 1992-1993 (Year 7), 1995-1996 (Year 10), 2000-2001 (Year 15), and 2005-2006 (Year 20). A majority of the group has been examined at each of the follow-up examinations (90%, 86%, 81%, 79%, 74%, and 72%, respectively).<p>  While the specifics of each examination has differed somewhat, data have been collected on a variety of factors believed to be related to heart disease. These include conditions with clear links to heart disease such as blood pressure, cholesterol and other lipids. Data have also been collected on physical measurements such as weight and skinfold fat as well as lifestyle factors such as substance use (tobacco and alcohol), dietary and exercise patterns, behavioral and psychological variables, medical and family history, and other chemistries (e.g., insulin and glucose). In addition, subclinical atherosclerosis was measured via echocardiography during Years 5 and 10, computed tomography during Years 15 and 20, and carotid ultrasound during Year 20. A detailed description of the study and results from the first examination are summarized in Cutter et al (Controlled Clinical Trials, Volume 12, Number 1 [supplement], pages 1S-77S, 1991).    * Study Weblinks: [Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE)][1]; [CARDIA][2]    * Study Type: Longitudinal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 0  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.pagestudy.org     [2]: http://www.cardia.dopm.uab.edu/  :::Longitudinal::: 0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000122.v1.p1::: Whole Genome Association Study of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus:::Study Description   The goal of this collaborative study was to identify new genetic risk factors for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). To do this we conducted a genome-wide scan by combining the resources and expertise from a number of SLE researchers to establish a large sample set comprising 1311 SLE cases and 3340 controls. The SLE case samples were genotyped from the following collections: 338 subjects from the Autoimmune Biomarkers Collaborative Network (ABCoN), an NIH/NIAMS funded repository, 141 subjects from the Multiple Autoimmune Disease Genetics Consortium (MADGC), 613 subjects from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Lupus Genetics, and 335 subjects from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), plus 8 samples collected at The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research.  A total of 3583 control samples were examined in the association analyses. As part of this project, 1861 control samples were selected and then genotyped from the New York Cancer Project (NYCP), based on self-described ethnicity, gender and age. In addition, genotype data from 1722 control samples (all self-described North Americans of European descent) were obtained from the publicly available iControlDB database ([http://www.illumina.com/pages.ilmn?ID=231][1]).    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 4651  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.illumina.com/pages.ilmn?ID=231  :::Case-Control::: 4651:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000095.v2.p1::: Dental Caries: Whole Genome Association and Gene x Environment Studies:::Study Description   Dental caries (also known as tooth decay) remains the most common chronic disease of childhood, five times more common than asthma and seven times more common than environmental allergies, with more than 40% of children exhibiting caries when they enter kindergarten. In 2005, it was estimated that dental health care costs were approximately $84 billion, of which 60% or about $50 billion were related to treatment of dental caries. Although overall caries prevalence has declined over the last 40 years, dental caries in the primary dentition and mean caries rates in children ages 2-11 has increased markedly over the past 12 years. Childhood caries is a serious public health issue because of associated health problems and because disparities in oral health have led to substantially higher average disease prevalence among children in poverty and in under-served racial and ethnic groups. These issues are of such concern that in 2005, the American Academy of Pediatrics made children's oral health one of their top areas of focus, as it is for the majority of the NIDCR "Disparities Centers".  The etiology of dental caries has been studied for many years. Multiple factors contribute to a person's risk for caries, including: 1) environmental factors such as diet, oral hygiene, fluoride exposure and the level of colonization of cariogenic bacteria and 2) host factors such as salivary flow, salivary buffering capacity, position of teeth relative to each other, surface characteristics of tooth enamel and depth of occlusal fissures on posterior teeth. In spite of all that is known about this disease, there are still individuals who appear to be more susceptible to caries and those who are extremely resistant, regardless of the environmental risk factors to which they are exposed, implying that genetic factors also play an important role in caries etiology. This conclusion is supported by studies in both humans and animals, with the most compelling evidence coming from studies of twins reared apart in which investigators found significant resemblance within monozygotic (MZ) but not dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs for percentage of teeth and surfaces restored or carious and estimated the genetic contribution to caries as 40%. Other recent studies of twins reared together estimated the heritability for caries, adjusted for age and gender, as ranging from 45-64%.  Despite the strong evidence of a genetic component to risk for dental caries, there have been only a few studies of candidate genes in caries, and no published genome-wide scans. A comprehensive genome wide search is the only approach that will allow us to identify those genetic regions likely to harbor genes increasing the risk for dental caries, and eventually to identify the etiologic genes and to explore the interaction of those genes with microbiological, dietary, fluoride, and behavioral factors that are known to be associated with caries risk and progression. **Therefore, the goal of this study is to perform genome-wide association (GWA) studies of dental caries with a large panel of SNP's (610,000) in families and individuals ascertained through multiple US sites (University of Pittsburgh and University of Iowa)**.  The v2 release of this study includes 96 additional individuals who were genotyped with the CCDG: Dental Caries and CL/P in Guatemala project (dbGaP accession number [phs000440][1]) to augment the data initially presented here. These subjects were genotyped on the Illumina 610 platform to make their data comparable.  This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [http://www.genevastudy.org][2]), which was developed through the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to dental caries through large-scale genome-wide association studies of well-characterized families and individuals at multiple sites in the U.S. Genotyping was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). The study was supported by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR, U01-DE018903). Data cleaning and harmonization were done at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.    * Study Types: Nuclear Families, Parent-Offspring Trios, Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 5418  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000440     [2]: http://www.genevastudy.org  :::Nuclear Families, Parent-Offspring Trios, Case-Control::: 5418:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Marazita. COHRA was established in 1999 as a consortium between the University of Pittsburgh and West Virginia University in response to the persistent and overwhelming oral health disparity found among the rural Appalachian population. Rural Appalachian disease patterns are characterized by early and significant onset of caries and/or periodontal disease, often leading to early tooth loss and ultimately culminating in complete edentulism by young adulthood. Recruitment for the study began in 2003. COHRA is funded by NIH/NIDCR (1R01-DE014899, "Genetic Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia"; R01-DE 014889-03S1, "Psychosocial Influences on Rural Children's Oral Health"; R01-DE 014889-04S1, "Oral Microbiology Studies in Appalachia"; and 2R01-DE013899, "Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia"), and relies heavily on Community Advisory Boards composed of local residents to guide investigation in a manner that is culturally appropriate and addresses perceived needs of the community.  The study sample is drawn from four rural Appalachian counties (two in West Virginia and two in Pennsylvania), and an urban sample in the Appalachian region. In order to participate in the COHRA study, a family must have at least one adult and at least one biological child of that adult (all family members resident in the same household must participate in order for a family to be "complete").  Participants receive a comprehensive orodental examination every two years conducted by a licensed dentist or dental hygienist in a well equipped, modern dental operatory. Data for each study participant, includes height, weight, body mass, orodental status and history, medical history, health behaviors, parental and family level variables, social adjustment, demographics (ethnicity, SES, etc), dental fear, fatalism, health attitudes, DNA source (blood, saliva), saliva, microbiological samples and assessments of bacteria (including _S. mutans_), water samples and fluoride assessments.  **DRDR site:** The University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine (SDM) instituted the Dental Registry and DNA Repository (DRDR) in 2008 under Dr. Alexandre Vieira as director. All individuals seeking treatment at the SDM are invited to be part of the program and to give permission to have the information on their dental chart be used for future research related to dental and craniofacial conditions, and provide a saliva sample for DNA analysis. Data in the DRDR include all the data in the SDM dental record (demographic, dental exams, tests including S mutans, diagnostic Xrays). DRDR is partially funded by the support from the University of Pittsburgh Clinical and Translational Science Institute (NIH/NCRR/CTSA grant number UL1-RR024153) and partially through SDM internal funding.  **University of Iowa - History:** The two University of Iowa sites are IOWA and GEIRS.  **IOWA:** The study families from the IOWA site were ascertained from one study time point of two related longitudinal studies, the Iowa Fluoride Study and the Iowa Bone Development Study under the leadership of Dr. Steven Levy.  **The Iowa Fluoride Study (IFS)** is a longitudinal study of children designed to quantify fluoride exposures from both dietary and non-dietary sources and to associate longitudinal fluoride exposures with dental fluorosis (spots on teeth) and dental caries (cavities). Mothers of newborns were recruited from 8 Iowa hospital postpartum units between 1992 and 1995. These hospitals were responsible for the large majority of all births in the area that they served, with a combined total of about 8,000 births per the Iowa Fluoride Study and the Iowa Bone Development Study, funded by NIDCR R01-DE09551 and R01-DE12101 year, or approximately 20 percent of all births in Iowa.  At recruitment, detailed information was obtained on items of interest such as demographics, water sources, and infant feeding plans. Thereafter, questionnaires were mailed to the participants' homes at scheduled intervals (every few months) and parents provided information about the children's water sources, beverage and selected food intake, use of dietary fluoride supplements, and tooth brushing habits. Approximately 50 percent of those invited to participate elected to do so. Overall, 1,368 mothers participated in some portion of the IFS, and approximately 700 children continue to be followed at 13 to 16 years of age.  Dental examinations were conducted by trained dentist examiners to assess dental fluorosis and caries in the primary (baby) teeth at the ages of 4 to 6. The teeth were examined again at ages 8 to 10 for any remaining primary teeth and early-erupting permanent teeth. We are currently close to completing dental examinations at age 13 to assess the full permanent dentition (other than third molars which do not usually come in until about 17 years old). In addition to overall tooth health, the study is looking at the relationships between children's sucking on pacifiers and fingers over time and malocclusion. IFS was funded by R01-DE09551.  **The Iowa Bone Development Study (IBDS)** was initiated in 1998 and involves children and their parents from families previously participating in the Iowa Fluoride Study (see above section) at that time. The study is assessing children's bone development over time through special, low radiation x-ray type procedures and relating the findings to detailed assessments of genetic, dietary (including fluoride and calcium), physical activity, anthropometric (height, weight, etc.), demographic, and parental factors.  DNA samples were obtained beginning in 1998 within the IBDS for bone study linkage only. In the last several years, additional consent has been obtained from the majority of study subjects/families to allow children's/parents' genetic samples to be used by our study team in analyses related to dental outcomes, including dental caries and fluorosis. IBDS was funded by R01-DE12101.  **GEIRS:** The study population of the GEIRS site was recruited by Dr. Rebecca Slayton primarily from Iowa Head Start programs. Subject ascertainment, collection of samples and analysis of candidate genes was initiated with pilot project funding from the Comprehensive Program to Investigate Craniofacial and Dental Anomalies (P60-DE-13076) and from the Oral Health Research Clinical Core Center (P30 DE10126) at the University of Iowa. Eligible children were three to five-years-of-age and enrolled in Head Start, a federally funded child development program for low income children. For each participant, dental examinations were conducted, DNA samples from buccal brushes, microbiological assays (for _S mutans_ and _Lactobacillus_). Funding for the GEIRS site was provided by P60-DE013076 and P30-DE010126.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Dr. Mary L. Marazita.

phs000287.v3.p1::: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) Cohort: an NHLBI-funded observational study of risk factors for cardiovascular disease in adults 65 years or older:::Study Description   ** Important Links and Information **    * [Data Use Certification Agreement][1]    * [Apply for Authorized Access ][2]    * [Acknowledgement Statements][3]  **Objectives**  The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is a study of risk factors for development and progression of CHD and stroke in people aged 65 years and older. The objectives of the Cardiovascular Health Study are to: 1) quantify associations of conventional and hypothesized risk factors with CHD and stroke; 2) assess the associations of non-invasive measures of subclinical disease with the incidence of CHD and stroke; 3) quantify the associations of risk factors with subclinical disease; 4) characterize the natural history of CHD and stroke, and identify factors associated with clinical course; and 5) describe the prevalence and distributions of risk factors, non-invasive measures of subclinical disease, and clinical CHD and stroke.  **Background**  The study originated in 1988 from the recommendations of an NHLBI workshop on the management of CHD in the elderly. This is the most extensive study undertaken by the NHLBI to study CVD exclusively in an elderly population. Initially funded for six years, it was renewed for a second six year period in 1994 and recently was renewed with limited support for the Coordinating Center, the Laboratory and the Steering Committee. Grant funding from several sources has supported an additional clinic visit in 2005-2006 and continued morbidity and mortality follow-up.  **Subjects**  The 5,888 study participants were recruited from four U.S. communities and have undergone extensive clinic examinations for evaluation of markers of subclinical cardiovascular disease. The original cohort totaled 5,201 participants. A new cohort was recruited in 1992. The 687 participants in the new cohort are predominately African-American and were recruited at three of the four field centers.  **Design**  The 2,962 women and 2,239 men were examined yearly from 1989 through 1999. The added minority cohort of 256 men and 431 women was examined from 1992 to 1999. Examination components have included medical history questionnaires, measurement of ankle-brachial index, abdominal and carotid ultrasound studies, echocardiograms, ambulatory electrocardiograms, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, spirometry and retinal photographs over the past decade. The most extensive evaluations were at study entry (baseline) and again in 1992-1993 to assess change in subclinical disease measures. CHS has undertaken extensive follow-up for ascertainment of cardiovascular events including incident claudication, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke and death.  **Genetic Research**  The Cardiovascular Health Study has expanded its research mission into the study of genetic factors underlying CVD and other disorders using DNA that was collected from blood samples from most participants. Subsets of CHS participants have been genotyped in large-scale genotyping projects, including thousands of SNP genotypes for candidate gene regions as part of the NHLBI Candidate gene Association Resource (CARe) and genome-wide genotyping as part of the NHLBI SNP Typing for Association with Multiple Phenotypes from Existing Epidemiologic Data (STAMPEED). Whole exome sequencing of an overlapping subset of CHS participants was performed through the NHLBI "Grand Opportunity" Exome Sequencing Project (GO-ESP).

The main objective is to identify factors related to the onset and course of heart disease and stroke. Subjects were recruited (as above) in 1989-90, and were followed with semi-annual contacts, alternating between telephone calls and surveillance clinic visits through 1998-99. A new cohort was recruited in 1992. The 687 participants in the new cohort are predominately African- American and were recruited at three of the four field centers.  At baseline, the mean age was 72 years and the cohort was 58% women, 16% African-American, and 31% had CVD. Participants were contacted twice per year, with phone follow-up alternating with clinic visits through 1999. Clinic exams included medical and personal history, medication inventory, ECG, blood pressure, and assessment of physical and cognitive function, depression. Other components done less frequently included phlebotomy, spirometry, echocardiography, carotid ultrasound, cranial MR, and retinal exam, Cardiovascular events were adjudicated by a committee.  After the CHS clinic exams ended in June 1999 and continuing through the present time, two phone calls per year to participants identified events and collected limited information. Grant funding from several sources has supported an additional clinic visit in 2005-2006 and continued morbidity and mortality follow-up.

phs000352.v1.p1::: The genomic complexity of sporadic and inherited retinoblastoma with a matched orthotopic xenograft:::Study Description   Retinoblastoma is a pediatric cancer of the developing retina. All retinoblastomas are believed to initiate with biallelic inactivation of the RB1 gene. To identify subsequent genetic lesions in retinoblastoma, we performed whole genome sequencing of tumor and normal DNA of 4 children with retinoblastoma and one matched orthotopic xenograft. Both alleles of RB1 were inactivated in the tumor samples. 3 of the patients had sporadic retinoblastoma and one patient had inherited retinoblastoma. Overall, there were few single nucleotide changes in coding regions of the genome and some of the tumors had few chromosomal lesions. There were very few new genetic lesions in the xenograft compared to the primary tumor. These data suggest that the genome in retinoblastoma is more stable than previously believed and there are relatively few recurrent genetic lesions in known cancer pathways other than the RB1 pathway.    * Study Types: Case Set, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal, Whole Genome Sequencing, Xenograft    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 46  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal, Whole Genome Sequencing, Xenograft::: 46:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000286.v4.p1::: Jackson Heart Study (JHS) Cohort:::Study Description   ** Important Links and Information **    * [Data Use Certification Agreement][1]    * [Apply for Authorized Access ][2]    * [Acknowledgement Statements][3]  The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) is a large, community-based, observational study whose participants were recruited from urban and rural areas of the three counties (Hinds, Madison and Rankin) that make up the Jackson Miss, metropolitan statistical area (MSA). Participants were enrolled from each of 4 recruitment pools: random, 17%; volunteer, 30%; currently enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, 31% and secondary family members, 22%. Recruitment was limited to non-institutionalized adult African Americans 35-84 years old, except in the family cohort where those 21 to 34 years of age were eligible. The final cohort of 5,301 participants includes 6.59% of all African American Jackson MSA residents aged 35-84 (N-76,426, US Census 2000). Major components of each exam include medical history, physical examination, blood/urine analytes and interview questions on areas such as: physical activity; stress, coping and spirituality; racism and discrimination; socioeconomic position; and access to health care. At 12-month intervals after the baseline clinic visit (Exam 1), participants are contacted by telephone to: update information; confirm vital statistics; document interim medical events, hospitalizations, and functional status; and obtain additional sociocultural information. Questions about medical events, symptoms of cardiovascular disease and functional status are repeated annually. Ongoing cohort surveillance includes abstraction of medical records and death certificates for relevant International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and adjudication of nonfatal events and deaths.  **The JHS Cohort is utilized in the following dbGaP sub-studies.** To view genotypes, other molecular data, and derived variables collected in these sub- studies, please click on the following sub-studies below or in the "Sub- studies" box located on the right hand side of this top-level study page [phs000286][4] JHS Cohort.    * [phs000402][5] HeartGO_JHS    * [phs000498][6] JHS_AllelicSpectrum_Seq    * [phs000499][7] JHS_CARe    * Study Weblink: [Jackson Heart Study][8]    * Study Type: Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 3597  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000286.v4.p1     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [3]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=JHSAcknowledgement.pdf     [4]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000286     [5]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000402     [6]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000498     [7]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000499     [8]: http://jhs.jsums.edu/jhsinfo/Default.aspx  :::Cohort::: 3597:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

The JHS represents an expansion of the Jackson, Mississippi site of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study which included three other geographically diverse U.S. communities (Minneapolis, Minnesota; Washington County, Maryland; and Forsyth County, North Carolina). The JHS was initiated in 1998 as a collaborative effort among three Jackson-area academic institutions. The JHS conducted three back-to-back cohort examinations, an initial clinic examination from 2000-2004, followed by a second exam 2005-2008 and another exam in 2009, to be completed in 2012. The completed JHS cohort examinations have produced extensive longitudinal data on traditional and putative CVD risk factors, socioeconomic and sociocultural factors and biochemical analytes; measures of subclinical disease from echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scans of the heart, aorta and abdomen; and stored biological samples. In addition, the JHS has conducted annual cohort follow-up contacts for incident clinical events of interest.

phs000478.v1.p1::: Strabismus, CCDD and other anomalies:::Study Description   Strabismus is one of the most common ophthalmological diseases affecting our population. It has many detrimental effects for affected individuals, including functional visual loss from amblyopia, secondary psychosocial difficulties, and limited employment opportunities. Strabismus also imposes a significant economical burden on society from the cost of screening programs, surgical correction, and lost productivity. Congenital incomitant strabismus is a broad term that encompasses congenital ocular motility disorders with restricted movement in one or more directions of gaze, and includes various forms of Duane's retraction syndrome, horizontal gaze palsy, congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles, and Moebius syndrome. Incomitant strabismus together with a group of related disorders such as congenital ptosis and congenital facial palsy have been collectively redefined as congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders (CCDDs). This redefinition stemmed from previous studies in the Engle lab showing that these disorders can be caused by mutations in genes encoding transcription factors critical to ocular cranial motor neuron development and by genes that encode proteins essential to the proper growth and guidance of developing axons. Thus, while these disorders account for only a small percent of strabismus, understanding their genetic etiology has led to our ability to provide genetic testing and counseling, and has provided the first insights into the molecular etiologies of strabismus. While the Engle lab has identified all seven CCDD genes published to date, our cohort still includes >100 familial CCDD pedigrees that are mutation-negative. We continue to utilize co-segregation analysis and whole exome or whole genome sequencing technologies to identify new disease genes in this mutation- negative cohort.    * Study Weblink: [Children's Hospital Boston - Engle Laboratory][1]    * Study Types: Probands, Mendelian, Family    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 13  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.childrenshospital.org/research/engle/  :::Probands, Mendelian, Family::: 13:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

[Instructions to Request Authorized Access][2]    3. [Data Use Certification Requirements (DUC)][3]    4. [Apply here for controlled access to individual level data][4]    5. [Research Use Statement][5]  Questions regarding GAW16 should be directed to Vanessa Olmo at [vanessa @business-endeavors.com][6].  **Problem 2: Description of the Framingham Heart Study**  In GAW16, we use data drawn from the Framingham Heart Study. The Framingham Heart Study -- under the direction of National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; NHLBI -- began in 1948 with the recruitment of adults from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. At the time, little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke, but the death rates for cardiovascular disease (CVD) had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the 20th century and had become an American epidemic. The Framingham Heart Study is now conducted in collaboration with Boston University.  The objective of the Framingham Heart Study was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke.  Between 1948 and 1953 the researchers recruited 5,209 subjects (2,336 men and 2,873 women) between the ages of 29 and 62 from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts and began the first round of extensive physical examinations and lifestyle interviews that they would later analyze for common patterns related to CVD development. Subjects were recruited from lists of addresses recorded for the town. Two out of every three households were approached for participation in the study. While there was no intention to recruit families for family studies, the plan was to recruit all household members in the ages 30-60 within each house that was selected for study. Hence, many biologically related individuals were recruited, including 1644 spouse pairs. Since 1948, these participants have returned to the study every two years for a detailed medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Now in 2008 at 60 years of follow up, there remain about 500 participants from this cohort.  Between 1971 and 1975 the study enrolled a second-generation group -- 5,124 of the original participants' children and the spouses of these children -- to participate in similar examinations. 2,616 subjects are offspring of the original spouse pairs and 34 are stepchildren. A total of 898 offspring are children of cohort members where only one parent was a study participant and 1,576 are spouses of the offspring. The Offspring Cohort has been followed every four years through 2001 (except between Exams 1 and 2 with an intervening 8 years) using protocols similar to those used for study of the Original Cohort.  Between 2002 and 2005 the study enrolled the third generation (Gen3) of the Framingham Heart Study - 4095 offspring of the second generation. None of their spouses were recruited. An additional 103 parents of this third generation, who were not recruited between 1971 and 1975, were also recruited at this time. The latter group is not included in the GAW16 data. With the recruitment of this third generation, the study has increasingly focused on genetic factors associated with the development of cardiovascular disease and its associated risk factors. To date, there is only one examination of this generation of participants. A description of the recruitment of this third generation and comparison with the earlier generations at their initial recruitment is presented in [Splansky GL et al., 2007][7].  Further information on the Study can be found at [http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/framingham/index.html][8].  **Genome-wide Dense SNP Scan in Framingham Heart Study**  Genetic studies did not begin in the FHS until the 1990s. In the late 1980s and through the 1990s DNA was extracted from blood samples of surviving FHS participants. In 2007, the FHS entered a new phase with the conduct of genotyping for the FHS SHARe (SNP Health Association Resource) project, for which dense SNP genotyping was performed using approximately 550,000 SNPs (GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set and the 50K Human Gene Focused Panel) in 10,775 samples (some duplicates) from the three generations of subjects (including over 900 pedigrees). Affymetrix conducted all genotyping for the FHS SHARe project, using the 250K Sty, 250K Nsp, and the supplemental 50K platforms. Eighty-nine percent of the DNA samples were collected during the 1990s. To maximize the power of the study, we also extracted DNA from 1133 blood samples, drawn from subjects who had no DNA, to include in the SHARe project. These samples had been sitting in our refrigerators for some time, a few as far back as the 1970s. We refer to these DNA samples as the legacy samples. These samples had a higher failure rate in the genotyping process (40%) than the other eighty-nine percent (3%). Affymetrix invoked its own criteria for a sample to succeed in genotyping. All non-legacy samples must succeed on all three platforms, while legacy samples needed to pass on at least one platform. When a sample failed, additional attempts were made. Samples that repeatedly failed 2-4 times were called failures. Other samples failed due to issues of genotyped sex identification not matching our records or low SNP concordance among SNPs common across arrays or contamination. Eighty-nine percent of the legacy samples for which genotyping results are available passed all three platforms. The genotyping data from the 10,043 samples from 9354 subjects that passed the Affymetrix criteria were additionally checked for gender consistency and consistency with family structure, resulting in genotyping data for 9,274 participants in FHS SHARe. Genotype calls were made with the BRLMM algorithm.  The SHARe database is housed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information [database of genotypes and phenotypes (NCBI dbGaP)][9] and contains all ~550,000 SNPs. This genome-wide dense SNP scan and a subset of phenotypes from the Framingham Heart Study are the focus of the Genetic Analysis Workshop 16.  Further information on the specific variables in the Problem 2 dataset can be found by clicking on the Documents tab at the top of the page.  **Problem 3: Description of the Simulated Data Set**  The focus of this simulation is gene discovery in genome-wide association scans (GWAS). The Framingham Heart Study data set (distributed as "Problem 2") is the basis for the FHS* simulated data. The pedigree structures are derived from the data distributed for Problem 2, and we distribute an accompanying triplet file (triplet_sim) containing person ID, father ID, mother ID, to ensure the identical subjects, pedigrees, and singletons are used in the simulated data analysis. Consistent with standard practice, founders and singletons are designated as subjects with both fshare and mshare equal to zero (missing). The simulated data includes a total of 6,479 subjects with both phenotype and genotype data, in 942 pedigrees distributed among 3 generations and 188 singletons. Data inclusion is consistent with the subjects' consent for use by both for-profit and not-for-profit researchers. The genotypes for all Problem 3 replicates are fixed as measured and distributed for Problem 2 for both the genomewide scan and the additional candidate gene SNPs, for a total of approximately 550,000 SNPs (GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set and the 50K Human Gene Focused Panel). Thus, to analyze the Problem 3 simulated data you also will need to download the Problem 2 genotypes. Note that there are slight discrepancies in counts between Problems 2 and 3 due to a change in consents between the two datasets.  Several phenotypes that contribute to coronary heart disease (CHD) were simulated for all individuals with genotypes across three different time points, 10 years apart. All genotyped individuals have complete data; the effects of missing values can be investigated by user-specified missing value patterns. There are 200 longitudinal datasets created, based on the generating model, and each replication is found in a separate dataset. We suggest that if only one replication is to be analyzed, that it be replication 1 to enable more precise comparisons among analytical approaches. The 'shareid' will allow you to merge the simulated phenotype data with the Problem 2 genotype data, and reconstruction of the pedigrees using the distributed 'triplet_sim' file or for larger families' relationships with the triplet distributed with the Problem 2.  The simulated data problem is further described in the associated readme file, and a data dictionary is provided defining all the variables.

phs000249.v1.p1::: Abundant Quantitative Trait Loci Exist for DNA Methylation and Gene Expression in Human Brain:::Study Description   In this paper (Gibbs et al., 2010, PMID: [20485568][1]) we describe a comprehensive assessment of the correlation between common genetic variability across the human genome, gene expression and DNA methylation, within human brain. We studied the cerebellum, frontal cortex, temporal cortex and pons regions of 150 individuals (600 tissue samples). In each tissue we assessed 27,578 DNA methylation sites and the expression level of 22,184 genes. Our research shows that DNA methylation and RNA expression patterns differ between brain regions. Further we show that DNA genotype is correlated with gene expression and DNA methylation, particularly when the genetic variation is close to the DNA methylation site or gene.    * Study Type: Control Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 150  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20485568  :::Control Set::: 150:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000393.v1.p1::: deCODE Genetics study on genes contributing to nicotine dependence in humans:::Study Description   A genome-wide association study on smoking behavior and nicotine dependence in Icelandic smokers, assessed by the number of cigarettes smoked per day, smoking initiation and degree of dependence on nicotine.  The number of cigarettes smoked per day was ascertained through questionnaires given to individuals participating in multiple disease projects at deCODE Genetics (n=16,483). Smoking initiation was analyzed by comparing those that have ever smoked (n=16,483) versus those that have never smoked (n=21,667). The nicotine dependence analysis included 3,435 nicotine dependent cases (score 4 or higher on Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) or endorsement of at least three of the seven Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria) and 3,344 low-quantity smokers as controls.    * Study Types: Case Set, Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access:  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set, Case-Control:::0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000371.v1.p1::: Genetic Modifiers of Huntington&#39;s Disease:::Study Description   Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder typically diagnosed in mid-life that is caused by expansion of an otherwise polymorphic CAG trinucleotide repeat. The mutation causes a gain-of-function of the huntingtin protein to trigger a pathogenic process that produces detectable phenotypic differences many years before the traditional diagnosis, which is based upon characteristic motor symptoms. The prediagnosis phase of pathogenesis is now the subject of intense scrutiny by an NINDS-funded longitudinal study, PREDICT-HD, in which undiagnosed gene carriers are followed longitudinally and subjected to detailed phenotyping (PREDICT-HD Huntington Disease Study -- dbGaP Study Accession: [phs000222][1]). This powerful approach, which offers the potential for moving the focus of therapeutic development to the decades prior to neurological disease diagnosis, is enabled by the fact that all individuals with HD have the same type of mutation, which can be determined at any time in life by a single HD CAG repeat PCR amplification assay. The precise length of the HD CAG repeat differs between individuals. There is a strong negative correlation between the number of CAG repeats and the age at onset of diagnostic neurological abnormalities in HD, such that the CAG repeat accounts for ~50% of the variation in age at diagnosis. Analysis of the remaining variance not explained by the length of the CAG repeat has shown that it is highly heritable, being due to genetic variation, elsewhere in the genome.  The intent of the Genetic Modifiers of Huntington's Disease study is to identify genetic modifiers of HD pathogenesis by using genomewide association techniques in diagnosed HD individuals to identify genetic factors associated with the residual variance in age at onset not explained by the CAG repeat, and to extend these analyses to pre-diagnosis phenotypes, for example, those defined in the PREDICT-HD study. Identification of modifier genes is a top priority for HD research (and an example of an approach that can be applied in other late-onset genetic disorders), as it could provide clues to developing rational treatments that delay or prevent the pathogenic process from causing the ravages of the disease that ensue in the ~15 years of inexorable decline to ultimate death that now follows clinical diagnosis.    * Study Type: Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 2803  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000222  :::Cohort::: 2803:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000353.v1.p1::: Genome-Wide Association Studies of Prematurity and Its Complications (African American):::Study Description   Preterm delivery resulting in the birth of a premature infant is a complex problem with a devastating impact on individuals, families and society. The prevalence of preterm birth has increased steadily in developed countries over the last 20 years and more than three million children die of preterm birth worldwide each year. Despite the importance of the problem and its disproportionate occurrence in poor and minority populations, the underlying causes have been difficult to identify. Spontaneous preterm labor has as its suspected triggers infection, stress, poor nutrition and inherited factors. The single best predictor for preterm delivery is a previous preterm birth. Studies of twins and of recurrences within families provide evidence that genetic factors underlie a substantive component of the risk for prematurity. One major challenge in studying genetic factors in prematurity is that the risk case is not truly established. The genetic risk could reside either in the mother and her uterus or in the infant/placenta. Identification of genetic factors in the mother and/or infant could provide insights into identifying relevant environmental covariates that may be more amenable to rapid interventions but difficult to find using standard epidemiology alone. A comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) is the ideal way to identify those genes that would not be suspected based on our current understanding of the biology of parturition. We are using 2200 African American samples with term or preterm labor. A subset of these (~800) are infant samples recruited by the Neonatal Research Network as part of a study on cytokines and infection in extremely low birth weight infants (Schelonka RL, et al., 2011. PMID: [21145756][1]). Therefore, this group consists of infants <1,000 grams with clinical outcome data for the infant allowing study of the genetic contributors for not only preterm birth but also the complications that often accompany preterm birth. The result will enable a better understanding of the biology of parturition and suggest environmental modifications that can prolong gestations to improve neonatal and adult outcomes.  This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [http://www.genevastudy.org][2]) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to preterm birth through large-scale genome-wide association studies of African-American cases and controls from multiple sites in the United States. Genotyping was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). Data cleaning and harmonization were done at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 3478  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21145756     [2]: http://www.genevastudy.org  :::Case-Control::: 3478:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

All samples from site 1 are premature case (23-29 gestational weeks) infants with maternal self report of African-American regarding the child's race. Samples from site 2 include African-American case (23-36 weeks) and control (37-41 weeks) mothers and infants. Infants were classified as African-American based on maternal self- reported race only. Samples from site 3 include African-American infant and mother cases (24-36 weeks). Infant race was defined as African-American if either parent self-reported African-American ancestry. Samples from site 4 include infant and mother cases (22-36 weeks) and controls (37-41 weeks). African-American race for the infant was determined if both maternal and paternal individuals self identified as African-American and Non-Hispanic ethnicity. Additionally, both maternal and paternal parents and grandparents also had to be self-identified Non-Hispanic African-Americans. Samples from site 5 include African-American infant and mother cases (23-36 weeks) and infant controls (37-42 weeks). Infants were classified as African-American based on maternal self-reported race only. All samples from site 6 are case (20-33 weeks) infants. For site 6, the project was a retrospective use of blood spot filter cards that had been collected as part of the study of infection and cytokines in very low birth weight (less than 1000 grams) neonates where a substantial portion of the populations were African-American.  :::HumanOmni1_Quad_v1-0_B:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Premature Birth ][1]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68047928[uid]  :::Study History   Although the central theme of the overall design was to collect case-parent trios, the aggregate group had a mixture of mother-baby pairs, isolated cases and isolated controls.

phs000428.v1.p1::: Health and Retirement Study (HRS):::Study Description   **Description:** The University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of Americans over the age of 50. Supported by the National Institute on Aging (NIA U01AG009740) and the Social Security Administration, the HRS is designed to provide reliable data on the decisions, choices, and behaviors of people as they age and respond to changes in public policy, the economy, and health.  The study obtains information every two years about income and wealth, health and use of health services, work and retirement, and family connections. Through its unique and in-depth interviews, the HRS provides an invaluable and growing body of multidisciplinary data that researchers can use to address important questions about the challenges and opportunities of aging. Because of its innovation and importance, the HRS has become the model and hub for a growing network of harmonized longitudinal aging studies around the world.  **Origins of the HRS.** As the population ages it is increasingly important to obtain reliable data about aging and topics that are relevant to a range of policy issues in aging. To address this need, the National Institutes on Aging (NIA) established a cooperative agreement with the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research to collect such data. The HRS launched data collection in 1992 and has re-interviewed the original sample of respondents every two years since then. By adding new cohorts and refreshing the sample, the HRS has grown to become the largest, most representative longitudinal panel study of Americans 50 years and older.  **HRS Study Design.** The target population for the original HRS cohort includes all adults in the contiguous United States born during the years 1931-1941 who reside in households, with a 2:1 oversample of African-American and Hispanic populations. The original sample is refreshed with new birth cohorts (51-56 years of age) every six years. The sample has been expanded over the years to include a broader range of birth cohorts as well. The target population for the AHEAD survey consists of United States household residents who were born in 1923 or earlier. Children of the Depression (CODA) recruits households born 1924-1930, Warbabies 1942-47, Early Boomers 1948-53, and Mid- Boomers 1954-59. The current sample is over 26,000 persons in 17,000 households.  Data collection includes a mixed mode design combining in-person, telephone, mail, and Internet. For consenting respondents, HRS data is linked at the individual level to administrative records from Social Security and Medicare claims.  **Genetic Research in the HRS.** The HRS is now genotyping 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on respondents using Illumina's Human Omni2.5-Quad (Omni2.5) BeadChip methodology. The genotyping is being performed by the NIH Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). Saliva was collected on half of the HRS sample each wave starting in 2006. In 2006, saliva was collected using a mouthwash collection method. In 2008, the data collection method switched to the Oragene kit. Saliva completion rates were 83% in 2006 and 84% in 2008. Based on prior rates of consent and completion, we expect an additional 6,000 Oragene samples to be added by 2012, including a substantial expansion of the minority sample.  **HRS Phenotypic data.** Phenotypic data are available on a variety of dimensions. Health measures include physical/psychological self-report, various health conditions, disabilities; cognitive performance; health behaviors (smoking, drinking, exercise), physical performance and anthropomorphic measures, and biomarkers (HbA1c, Total Cholesterol, HDL, CRP, Cystatin-C). Data are also available on health services including utilization, insurance and out-of-pocket spending with linkage to Medicare records. Economic measures include employment status/history, earnings, disability, retirement, type of work, income by source, wealth by asset type, capital gains/debt, consumption, linkage to pensions, Social Security earnings/benefit histories. There is also extensive information on family structure, proximity, transfers to/from of money, time, social and psychological characteristics, as well as a wide range of demographics.  Performance on a cognitive test combining immediate and delayed word recall was selected as an example trait for the dbGaP data release. In the immediate word recall task the interviewer reads a list of 10 nouns to the respondent and asks the respondent to recall as many words as possible from the list in any order. After approximately five minutes of asking other survey questions, the respondent is asked to recall the nouns previously presented as part of the immediate recall task. The total recall score is the sum of the correct answers to these two tasks, with a range of 0 to 20.  Researchers who wish to link to other HRS measures not in dbGaP will be able to apply for access from HRS. A separate Data Use Agreement (DUA) will be required for linkage to the HRS data.

The sample was selected at the household-level to ensure that the same request was made to both members of a household. New spouses of respondents flagged to complete an enhanced face-to-face interview were also asked to do so.<p>  Approximately fifty percent of households with at least one living respondent were selected for the enhanced face-to-face interview across all primary sampling units (PSUs). Some respondents who were selected for the enhanced face-to-face sample were not asked to complete the physical measures or biomarkers. This group included respondents who a) needed to be interviewed by proxy, b) resided in a nursing home, or c) declined a face-to-face interview but agreed to be interviewed by telephone.  In 2008, an enhanced face-to-face interview was conducted on the remaining half of the sample.  **Consent Procedures**  > Prior to saliva collection, a consent form was administered by the interviewer. Respondents were asked to read and sign the form. Respondents who did not sign the consent form were not asked to complete the collection. After obtaining consent, the interviewer described the collection procedure to the respondent. Respondents were instructed not to eat, drink, smoke, chew gum or brush their teeth during this component of the interview.<p>  :::HumanOmni2.5:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [

phs000218.v8.p1::: National Cancer Institute (NCI) TARGET: Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments:::Study Description   The Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) Initiative seeks to accelerate research in novel marker and drug development, along with understanding the molecular basis of pediatric malignancy, through identification of genomic changes associated with the following childhood cancers:    * Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) - A fast-growing type of blood cancer in which too many immature white blood cells are found in the blood and bone marrow.    * Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) - Another type of blood cancer marked by too many myeloblasts, an alternate type of immature white blood cell, are found in the blood and bone marrow.    * Neuroblastoma (NBL) - Cancer of cells of the sympathetic nervous system.    * Osteosarcoma (OS) - A cancer of the bone that primarily affects children and adolescents.    * Wilms' Tumor (WT) - A cancer of cells in the kidney that can spread to the liver, lung and lymph nodes.  Together these cancers account for the majority of the more than 10,000 childhood cancer cases diagnosed in the United States each year.  TARGET is employing a set of advanced and complementary genome analysis technologies, including large scale 2nd and 3rd generation genome sequencing, to strategically characterize alterations in both gene expression and in genomic structure (such as deletions and amplification) that are involved in childhood cancers. The goal of this coordinated effort is a comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic profile of each cancer. Integrated analysis of the TARGET data will identify those genes that are either altered in their expression level or mapped to the chromosome regions of deletion/amplification/translocation, as these genes represent strong candidates for therapeutic targeting. To learn more about the TARGET project, visit the website at [http://target.cancer.gov/][1].  *Additional renal tumors are being added to the TARGET Initiative (clear cell sarcoma of the kidney - CCSK, and rhabdoid tumor - RT), along with some sequencing of cell lines and xenografts in conjunction with the NCI PPTP project. **More information can be found about each TARGET subproject by following the links on the lefthand side of this page.**  TARGET primary genomic sequencing datasets (controlled-access) and limited phenotype data (open-access) are available from this site. TARGET characterization data will be deposited into the TARGET Data Coordinating Center (DCC) database, which is supported by the cancer bioinformatics grid (caBIG), while the sequence data is deposited either into the NCBI's trace repository or the sequence read archive (SRA). Comprehensive access to TARGET datasets, including molecular characterization (e.g. gene expression, copy number variation and epigenetics), full clinical information, and targeted sequencing linking tables, is available via the TARGET [Data Portal][2].    * Study Weblink: [TARGET Data Portal.

phs000291.v2.p1::: NHLBI GO-ESP: Lung Cohorts Exome Sequencing Project (Lung Health Study of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease):::Study Description   The NHLBI "Grand Opportunity" Exome Sequencing Project (GO-ESP), a signature project of the NHLBI Recovery Act investment, was designed to identify genetic variants in coding regions (exons) of the human genome (the "exome") that are associated with heart, lung and blood diseases. These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied. These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease, contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention and treatments to specific populations. This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects. GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers - BroadGO and SeattleGO.  The Lung Health Study I was a randomized multicenter clinical trial with 5887 participants carried out from October 1986 to April 1994, designed to test the effectiveness of smoking cessation and bronchodilator administration in smokers aged 35 to 60 with mild lung function impairment. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups:    * usual care, who received no intervention    * smoking intervention with the inhaled bronchodilator ipratroprium bromide    * smoking intervention with an inhaled placebo  The effect of intervention was evaluated by the rate of decline of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).    * Study Weblinks: [Lung Health Study][1]; [NHLBI GO ESP Project][2]    * Study Types: Longitudinal, Exome Sequencing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 337  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.biostat.umn.edu/lhs/     [2]: http://esp.gs.washington.edu/drupal/  :::Longitudinal, Exome Sequencing::: 337:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

EGAS00001000061::: Lethal malformation syndrome:::Study Description       Identification of the genetic basis of rare monogenic diseases can provide insights into disease mechanisms, biological pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Exome sequencing has proven to be a powerful, efficient strategy for the identification of the genes underlying rare Mendelian disorders. The genetic defect behind the lethal malformation syndrome under study is known in some cases and has proven useful in revealing the primary underlying defect. We have six typical unrelated families with no known mutation. The aim of this study is to identify the locus associated with this lethal malformation syndrome in these families using exome sequencing.    * Study Weblink: [][1]    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access:  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]:  ::: :::0::: ::: ::: ::: ::: :::

phs000564.v1.p1::: Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing for Genetic Disease Diagnosis in Neonatal Intensive Care Units:::Study Description   Monogenic diseases are frequent causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality, and disease presentations are often undifferentiated at birth. More than 3,500 monogenic diseases have been characterized, but clinical testing is available for only some of them and many feature clinical and genetic heterogeneity. As such, an immense unmet need exists for improved molecular diagnosis in infants. Because disease progression is extremely rapid, albeit heterogeneous, in newborns, molecular diagnoses must occur quickly to be relevant for clinical decision-making. We describe 50-hour differential diagnosis of genetic disorders by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) that features automated bioinformatic analysis and is intended to be a prototype for use in neonatal intensive care units. Retrospective 50-hour WGS identified known molecular diagnoses in two children. Prospective WGS disclosed potential molecular diagnosis of a severe _GJB2_-related skin disease in one neonate; _BRAT1_- related lethal neonatal rigidity and multifocal seizure syndrome in another infant, identified _BCL9L_ as a novel, recessive visceral heterotaxy gene (_HTX6_) in a pedigree, and ruled out known candidate genes in one infants. Sequencing of parents or affected siblings expedited the identification of disease gene in prospective cases. Thus, rapid WGS can potentially broaden and foreshorten differential diagnosis, resulting in fewer empirical treatments and faster progression to genetic and prognostic counseling.

These samples (UDXXXX) were selected from a validation set of 384 samples with known molecular diagnoses for one or more genetic diseases.  To assess the potential diagnostic use of WGS, sequencing was prospectively performed on four undiagnosed newborns with clinical presentations that strongly suggested a genetic disorder as well as one affected sibling and their unaffected parents. Seven prospective samples were selected from families with probands that presented in infancy, among 143 individuals without molecular diagnoses who were enrolled between November 2011 and April 2012 for exome or genome sequencing.  :::HiSeq 2500:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Tay-Sachs Disease ][1]    * [ Menkes Kinky Hair Syndrome ][2]    * [ Heterotaxy Syndrome ][3]    * [ Epidermolysis Bullosa ][4]    * [ Epilepsy ][5]    * [ Mitochondrial Diseases ][6]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68013661[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68007706[uid]     [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68059446[uid]     [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68004820[uid]     [5]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68004827[uid]     [6]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68028361[uid]  ::: :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Stephen Kingsmore, MB, ChB, BAO, DSc, FRCPath.

phs000169.v1.p1::: Whole Genome Association Study of Visceral Adiposity in the Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study:::Study Description   The Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study is a NIA-sponsored cohort study of the factors that contribute to incident disability and the decline in function of healthier older persons, with a particular emphasis on changes in body composition in old age. Between 4/15/97 and 6/5/98 the Health ABC study has recruited 3,075 70-79 year old community-dwelling adults (41% African-American), who were initially free of mobility and activities of daily living disability. The key components of Health ABC include a baseline exam, annual follow-up clinical exams, and phone contacts every 6 months to identify major health events and document functional status between clinic visits.  The core yearly examination for HEALTH ABC includes measurement of body composition by dual energy x-ray absorptio-metry (DXA), walking ability, strength, an interview that includes self-report of limitations, and a medication survey, weight. At baseline, visceral adiposity was measured by computerized tomography (CT). Provision has been made for banking of blood specimens and extracted DNA (HealthABC repository). The overall goal of this project is to identify genetic determinants of visceral adiposity. Genetic samples from 2932 unrelated participants were evaluated with a genome-wide scan.    * Study Weblinks: [NIA Health ABC Description][1]; [NIA Health ABC][2]    * Study Types: Longitudinal, Cross-Sectional    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 2802  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.nia.nih.gov/ResearchInformation/ScientificResources/HealthA BCDescription.htm     [2]: http://www.grc.nia.nih.gov/branches/ledb/healthabc/index.htm  :::Longitudinal, Cross-Sectional::: 2802:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

A large number of individuals with type 1 diabetes were screened to identify two subsets, one with clear-cut kidney disease and another with normal renal status despite long-term diabetes. Those who met additional entry criteria and consented to participate were enrolled. When possible, both parents were also enrolled to form family trios. Altogether, GoKinD includes 3043 participants comprising 931 cases, 944 singletons, 268 pairs of parents of cases, and 316 pairs of parents of control. Accessible as a GAIN database are 905 of the cases, 890 of the controls, 10 pairs of parents of cases and 10 pairs of parents of controls. The other parents and the remaining cases and controls are available by a separate application process through NIDDK (dbGaP [phs000088][4] _Search for Susceptibility Genes for Diabetic Nephropathy in Type 1 Diabetes (GoKinD study participants and parents), NIDDK_).

phs000482.v1.p1::: Sporadic autism exomes reveal a highly interconnected protein network of de novo mutations:::Study Description   It is well established that autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have a strong genetic component; however, for at least 70% of cases, the underlying genetic cause is unknown. Under the hypothesis that de novo mutations underlie a substantial fraction of the risk for developing ASD in families with no previous history of ASD or related phenotypes-so-called sporadic or simplex families-we sequenced all coding regions of the genome (the exome) for parent- child trios exhibiting sporadic ASD, including 189 new trios and 20 that were previously reported. Additionally, we also sequenced the exomes of 50 unaffected siblings corresponding to these new (n = 31) and previously reported trios (n = 19), for a total of 617 individual exomes from 209 families deposited in dbGaP. Here we show that de novo point mutations are overwhelmingly paternal in origin (4:1 bias) and positively correlated with paternal age, consistent with the modest increased risk for children of older fathers to develop ASD. Moreover, 39% (49 of 126) of the most severe or disruptive de novo mutations map to a highly interconnected beta- catenin/chromatin remodelling protein network ranked significantly for autism candidate genes. In proband exomes, recurrent protein-altering mutations were observed in two genes: CHD8 and NTNG1. Mutation screening of six candidate genes in 1,703 ASD probands identified additional de novo, protein-altering mutations in GRIN2B, LAMC3 and SCN1A. Combined with copy number variant (CNV) data, these results indicate extreme locus heterogeneity but also provide a target for future discovery, diagnostics and therapeutics.    * Study Types: Parent-Offspring Trios, Parent-Offspring Quads    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 617  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Parent-Offspring Trios, Parent-Offspring Quads::: 617:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000235.v6.p1::: National Cancer Institute Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI):::Study Description   The Office of Cancer Genomics at the National Cancer Institute is sponsoring a series of studies as part of the Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI) to assess novel emerging sequencing technologies in cancer. The CGCI program includes comprehensive characterization of the genetic aberrations found in different pediatric and/or adult tumors.  CGCI is currently characterizing a number of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) from patients with and without HIV+ infection, follicular lymphoma (FL), as well as adult and pediatric Burkitt lymphomas), medulloblastoma (MB), additional HIV-associated tumors (including lung and cervical cancers), and early stage lung cancers; additional tumor types to be characterized in the future. All data from these projects will be released into publicly accessible databases, with a majority of data in an open-access tier. A subset of data will be available only through a controlled-access tier due to patient privacy concerns.  **Individual project descriptions are available by disease on the substudy pages, (can be found on the righthand side of this page), however brief summaries are as follows:**    * **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)** - CGCI investigators are probing genomic alterations more deeply than has been previously possible by using state-of- the-art RNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) and whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) coupled with leading edge bioinformatics, data management and analysis approaches. To date the project has sequenced tumor DNA and/or RNA from 117 NHL tumor samples and 10 cell lines. This includes the genomes or exomes of 1 Follicular Lymphoma (FL) and 13 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cases, all with matched constitutional DNA sequenced to comparable depths, RNA- sequencing (mRNA-seq) of 92 DLBCL, 12 FL and 8 B-cell NHL cases with other histologies and 10 DLBCL-derived cell lines. The DLBCL cases and cell-lines are from the two major subtypes of DLBCL: germinal center B-cell (GCB) and activated B-cell (ABC).   > <li><b>Medulloblastoma (MB)<b> - In order to identify the genetic alterations in MB, copy number alterations were sought using high-density microarrays and sequenced all known protein-coding genes and miRNA genes using Sanger sequencing in a set of 22 pediatric MB samples and one matched normal blood sample. All tumor samples were obtained at the time of original surgery (pre-treatment) except for one sample, which was obtained at the time of MB recurrence. The protein encoding transcripts were supplemented with microRNA transcripts downloaded from the Sanger miRBase Sequence Database (Release 13.0) in order to yield a combined set of transcripts representing 24,893 genes (24,178 protein encoding and 715 microRNA). The regions of interest (ROIs) targeted for sequencing comprised the entire transcribed portion of the microRNA exons and the protein encoding portion plus 4 bases of flanking sequence for the protein encoding exons. Illumina Infinium II Whole Genome Genotyping Assay employing the BeadChip platform was used to analyze the same set of tumor samples at 1,199,187 (1M-Duo) SNP loci in order to detect copy number alterations in the same set of tumors.   > <li><b>HIV+ Tumor Molecular Characterization Project (HTMCP)<b> - This project is a joint effort of the Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG) and the Office of HIV and AIDS Malignancy (OHAM). Its goals are to characterize HIV- associated cancers (obtained from HIV-infected patients) and compare them to the same types of cancers from patients without HIV infection. Investigators will perform 30X genome sequencing of 100 cases of paired tumor and germline DNA, along with transcriptome sequencing in each of 3 types of HIV+ tumors (DLBCL, lung and cervical cancers). These platforms allow discovery of mutations both in coding and non-coding genomic regions, gene expression and genomic alterations (including translocations, insertions and deletions). Comparing tumors of cancer patients both with and without HIV-infection will provide insight into the potential function of this virus in certain cancers.   > <li><b>Burkitt Lymphoma Genome Sequencing Project (BLGSP)<b> - This project is a collaborative effort between the National Cancer Institute and the Foundation for Burkitt Lymphoma Research to develop a databank of the many alterations found in Burkitt lymphoma (BL), an uncommon type of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs most often in children and young adults. The goal of the BLGSP is to explore potential genetic changes in patients with BL that could lead to better prevention, detection and treatment of the cancer. The project will characterize the alterations of the tumors' genomes (with matched normal as control) and transcriptomes by sequencing the DNA and RNA of each case. Using the data generated, the ultimate goals of the project are to discover the molecular changes that are present in BL patients and then determine how those changes correlate with treatment regimen and outcome.  _Other Grants Administered by OCG:_    * **RC1 Human Lung Carcinogenesis** - Investigators will pursue the identification of transcriptome and epigenome loci that categorize to pathologically-confirmed normal, dysplastic, and malignant epithelial phenotypes in an intra-individual comparison. Initial discovery transcriptome, and epigenome-wide marks of possible phenotypic significance will be verified and refined with high density epigenetic reference techniques. This in turn will yield candidate pathway approaches to be pursued in future prospective biomarker studies aimed at risk assessment, early diagnosis, and targeted therapies. For the genome-wide phases, the surgically-resected, snap frozen human lung tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from >25 donors will be utilized. The mRNA levels will be surveyed using expression microarrays, and then verified by laboratory-developed RNA-specific mRNA-PCR. Methylome-wide HpaII tiny fragment Enrichment Ligation-mediated PCR (HELP-seq by massively parallel sequencing) assay will be used to explore the epigenome, with phenotype-differentiating loci verified by deeper sequencing using mass spectroscopy-based sequencing (MassArray) and re-verified at key loci using the laboratory-developed tagged bisulfite genomic sequencing (tBGS). MicroRNA- seq by parallel sequencing will be used to assay the micronome, verified by both microRNA-qPCR and microRNA pull-down as developed in the Spivack laboratory.  As described above, the projects currently involved in CGCI will provide various data to include whole genomic, transcriptomic and mutational analyses of the tumor types being studied. This page will be amended as additional projects and characterization platforms are added to the CGCI portfolio.    * Study Weblink: [The Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative][1]    * Study Types: Cohort, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 158  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/cgci.html  :::Cohort, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal::: 158:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Alterations at the DNA level drive the cellular changes that are hallmarks of cancer including aberrant cell division and survival. Historically, genetic causes of cancer were studied by analysis of one or a few genes at a time. More recently however, novel high-throughput technologies have provided unprecedented capabilities to examine the cancer genome. These technologies allow systematic characterization of genetic and epigenetic alterations, allowing investigators to identify the underlying genetic changes found in cancer. The CGCI incorporates multiple approaches for genomic characterization including exome sequencing and transcriptome analysis using next generation sequencing. To encourage collaboration and leverage the collective knowledge and innovation of the entire cancer research community, all data collected will be publicly available through databases supported by the National Institutes of Health and National Cancer Institute.  NHL, Medulloblastoma, and some HTMCP (DLBCL and lung) and RC1 Human Lung Carcinogenesis cases have data available at NCBI and NCI repositories. Sequence data stored in the NCBI databases can be accessed through the dbGaP parent and substudy sites. Additional data can be accessed through individual project Data Matrices located within the [CGCI website][1].

phs000142.v1.p1::: A Whole Genome Association Scan for Myopia and Glaucoma Endophenotypes using Twin Studies:::Study Description   Myopia and glaucoma are highly prevalent ophthalmic disorders worldwide and contribute significantly to ocular morbidity. There is substantial evidence that genetic factors play a significant role in the development of non- syndromic myopia and glaucoma. We propose to perform mapping studies for well- characterized twin populations in the United Kingdom and Australia in order to ultimately identify implicated genes for these disorders and related ocular parameters. This will provide a fundamental molecular understanding of how these disorders develop, and may lead to directed physiologic (i.e. pharmacologic, gene therapy) interventions.  Our aim is to dissect the genetic basis of the eye disorders myopia and glaucoma. Instead of limited analyses of the trait/disease in a dichotomous manner, we are using continuous phenotypes of measures of refraction and intermediate phenotypes of glaucoma to analyze quantitative traits in unselected population samples of volunteer twins. Achievement of this goal requires cooperative efforts and large sample sizes. Thus, we have created an international collaboration of large complementary studies.    * Study Type: Twin    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 2928  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Twin::: 2928:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

We have performed comprehensive ophthalmic examination of 800 DZ twin pairs (500 in Queensland and 300 in Tasmania), and 2000 DZ twin pairs and 1000 MZ samples in the UK for glaucoma and myopia endophenotypes. These subjects have been consented for DNA genetic study.  We wish to conduct the CIDR SNP WGA scan on all of these individuals, and analyze these SNP data in both linkage and association studies, to identify regions of the human genome likely to contain loci that influence variation in these measurements. The goal is to identify the genes in these loci associated with a particular trait. We will also compare and analyze the genes and loci identified by this twin genome-wide scan with other myopia and glaucoma mapping and gene discovery studies. These include the 280 multiplex pedigrees of the International Myopia Consortium (Dr. Young-PI) and the Glaucoma Inheritance Study in Tasmania (Dr. Mackey-PI), with over 400 glaucoma pedigrees and 2000 cases of glaucoma.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Terri L.

phs000181.v1.p1::: Genomewide Association Study of Alcohol Use and Alcohol Use Disorder in Australian Twin-Families (OZ-ALC GWAS):::Study Description   The Australian twin-family study of alcohol use disorder (OZALC study) derives from telephone diagnostic interview studies of two general population volunteer cohorts of Australian twins (cohort 1, mostly born 1940-1964; cohort 2, born 1964-71) and the spouses of the former cohort - a total of over 11,000 families. Three coordinated studies, using a shared assessment protocol and with a shared goal of gene-discovery, were conducted - one funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the others by the National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse - by investigators associated with the Midwest Alcoholism Research Center at Washington University in St. Louis, and investigators at Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Australia (led by Professor Nicholas Martin), using informative families identified from these cohorts. The first of these (NIDA Nicotine Addiction Genetics [NAG] project, PI Pamela Madden) identified index cases from the 3 cohorts with a history of heavy smoking (smoked 20 or more cigarettes daily, or 40 or more cigarettes on 1 or more occasions) and with additional available full siblings who were smokers, and interviewed and obtained blood samples from twins, and cooperative full siblings and parents, in order to identify families that would be informative for linkage analysis of a quantitative heaviness of smoking trait. The second identified additional families with an index case who either reported a history of alcohol dependence (DSM-IV), or scored above the 85th percentile on a quantitative measure of heaviness of alcohol use (alcohol factor score), derived from measures of frequency of heavy drinking, frequency of drinking to intoxication, and typical weekly consumption in standard drinks (all referenced to the respondent's heaviest drinking period) and of lifetime maximum 1-day alcohol consumption and maximum tolerance to alcohol (drinks before getting drunk or before feeling effects of alcohol). Interview and DNA were obtained from index cases and siblings, and DNA only from available parents. The goal of this second study (NIAAA OZ-ALCOHOL EDAC study, PI Andrew Heath) was to identify sibships including pairs who were either extreme concordant for the quantitative consumption measure (both scoring above the 85th percentile) or extreme discordant (one scoring above the 85th percentile and one scoring below the 30th percentile) that would be informative for linkage analysis. The third identified additional sibships solely on the basis of large sibship size, regardless of alcohol or tobacco use phenotypes (NIAAA OZ-BIGSIB study, PIs the late Richard Todd, Andrew Heath). From these coordinated studies a case-control series of alcohol dependent individuals and unaffected controls were constructed for a family- based Genomewide Association Study (OZALC-GWAS) of heaviness of alcohol use and alcohol dependence, funded by the National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse. These data are made available here for all investigators studying outcomes related to alcohol or tobacco use (including major depressive disorder).    * Study Weblink: [Midwest Alcoholism Research Center][1]    * Study Types: Twin, Family    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 6775  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.alcoholdependence.org  :::Twin, Family::: 6775:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000384.v1.p1::: Genentech whole genome and transcriptome sequencing of four hepatocellular carcinoma patients:::Study Description   Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study we sequenced the whole genome (~80X) and transcriptome of tumor and non-tumor samples from four HCC patients and identified over two hundred HBV integration sites. We found significant clonal expansion of HBV-integrated hepatocytes specifically in the tumor samples. We observed a diverse collection of genomic perturbations near viral integration sites, including gene disruption, viral promoter-driven human transcription, viral-human transcript fusion and DNA copy number alteration. We also sequenced one patient at ultra-high coverage (~240X) to build the most comprehensive HBV-integration landscape yet attempted. Our data suggest that the viral integration significantly expands carcinogenic opportunities in HBV- infected individuals.    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 4  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set::: 4:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000259.v2.p1::: Urethral Microbiome of Adolescent Males:::Study Description   Urethral microbiome of adolescent males is designed to characterize the microbial communities resident in the urethra of young men, to identify differences in these communities as a function of race/ethnicity, circumcision status, sexual exposures, and uro-genital symptoms. We collect detailed sexual behavior and symptoms data using cellular telephones with Internet access. Specimens are routinely collected at monthly intervals, and intermittently following reported symptoms, specific sexual exposures, or identification of a sexually transmitted infection. We also collect periodic samples from the penile coronal sulcus to better characterize its relationship to the urethral micriobial communities.  Participants are ages 14 - 17 at enrollment, and prior history of sexual exposure is not required for participation. Parental permission is obtained for each participant. The planned duration of followup is up to 4 years allowing for prospective observation of both physical and behavioral maturation from middle adolescence into young adulthood.  The overall objectives of the project are to better characterize the healthy male urethral microbiome, and to use this information to better understand acquisition of urethritis and sexually transmitted infections, as well as chronic genital pain and prostatitis syndromes that become common among young adults.    * Study Types: Longitudinal, Observational, Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 55  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Longitudinal, Observational, Cohort::: 55:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000260.v2.p1::: Foregut Microbiome in Development of Esophageal Adenocarcinoma:::Study Description   The distal esophagus is an important anatomical area where gastric acid reflux can cause reflux esophagitis (RE), Barrett's esophagus (BE) (intestinal metaplasia), and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA). The incidence of EA has increased 6-fold in the U.S. since the 1970s, parallel to a significant increase in the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux diseases (GERD). Although specific host factors might predispose one to disease risk, such a rapid increase in incidence must be predominantly environmental. The cause remains unknown. Our hypothesis is that changes in the foregut microbiome are associated with EA and its precursors, RE and BE in the GERD sequence.  We will conduct a case control study to demonstrate the microbiome-disease association in every stage of GERD sequence as well as analyze the trend in changes in the microbiome along disease progression toward EA.  Specific Aim 1. To conduct a comprehensive population survey of the foregut microbiome and demonstrate its association with GERD sequence, by 16S rRNA gene survey. We will analyze samples of the foregut microbiome at three anatomic loci: mouth, distal esophagus, and gastric corpus. Changes of the microbiota in the distal esophagus will be correlated with the phenotypes. Spatial relationship between the esophageal microbiota and upstream (mouth) and downstream (stomach) foregut microbiotas as well as temporal stability of the microbiome-disease association will also be examined.  Specific Aim 2. To define distal esophageal metagenome and demonstrate its association with GERD sequence, by shotgun metagenomic analysis. We will first classify samples of the metagenome into metagenotypes by between-sample k-mer distance and correlate the metagenotypes with the four phenotypes. Subsequent detailed analyses will include pathway-disease and gene-disease associations. DNA viruses and fungi, if identified, also will be correlated with the phenotypes.  A significant association between the foregut microbiome and GERD sequence, if demonstrated, will be the first step for eventually testing the causal hypothesis that an abnormal microbiome is required for the development of the sequence of phenotypic changes toward EA.  If EA and its precursors represent a microbial ecological disease, treating the cause of GERD might become possible, for example, by normalizing the microbiome through use of antibiotics, probiotics, or prebiotics. Causative therapy for GERD could prevent its progression and reverse the current trend of increasing incidence of EA.    * Study Weblink: [Foregut Microbiome in the Development of Esophageal Adenocarcinoma][1]    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 42  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://gerd.med.nyu.edu/  :::Case-Control::: 42:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

A subject will be considered for enrollment into this study if the results of hisher screening examinations are diagnostic for one of the following four phenotypes:    1. _Healthy control:_ Healthy control will be selected from subjects who present to the GI Clinics with symptoms requiring upper GI endoscopic examination and/or other diagnostic tests. The healthy control should meet all of one of the following sets of criteria: 1) normal endoscopic findings, 2) normal pH range with 48-hour pH monitoring study, and 3) no reflux symptoms, such as heart burn; **_OR_** 1) histopathological examination shows no inflammatory infiltrate or only less than 10 lymphocytes per high power field (HPF, 400x magnification) in the squamous epithelium, 2) normal pH range with 48-hour pH monitoring study, and 3) no reflux symptoms, such as heart burn.    2. _Reflux esophagitis (RE):_ Esophagitis will be determined either: histologically, characterized by basal zone hyperplasia exceeding 20% of the epithelial thickness, papillae extending into the superficial third of the epithelium, and presence of lymphocytes equal to or more than 10 cells/HPF or any numbers of eosinophils or polymorphonuclear leukocytes **_OR_** based on endoscopic findings consistent with reflux esophagitis. Symptoms of reflux will also be inquired about at each patient visit, and reflux will be detected by using 48-h pH monitoring.    3. _Barrett's esophagus (BE):_ esophageal squamous epithelium replaced by intestinal-type epithelial cells and goblet cells.    4. _Esophageal Adenocarcinoma (EA):_ atypical, infiltrative intestinal-type glands associated with desmoplasia. This phenotype also includes high grade dysplasia (carcinoma in situ).  The final decision on enrollment of a subject will be determined by frequency- match on gender, ethnic background, and age within 10 years.  **Exclusion Criteria:**  > <ol> <li>Use of antibioics within 2 weeks before the scheduled endoscopic examination<li>  * Previous gastric/esophageal surgery  * Active infection of the oral cavity  * Active gastric ulcer disease, or gastric cancer  * Persons younger than 50 years of age, because GERD and its complications are mainly diseases of older populations  * Pregnant women, because the natural history of reflux disease in pregnancy is different from GERD in general populations that leads to metaplasia and/or dysplasia  * Persons with an HIV infection will be excluded  * For safety reasons, we wll exclude potential subjects with coagulopathy (INR > 2.0) or thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50) since this study involves repeated mucosal sampling.  * We will also exclude potential subjects at high risk for developing endocarditis, such as those with a history of endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease, or heart valve prosthesis who might require antibiotic prophylaxis for the endoscopic examination.  * We will exclude potential subjects with a history of intestinal ischemia and those with severe cardiopulmonary disease, or neurological impairment.  * We will exclude any subject who has an imperforate anus, recent anal or rectal surgery.  * English speakers will be excluded. Our project addresses the increasing incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in the US which has increased > 6-fold since the 1970s, but in other parts of the world except Western Europe the trend is stable. Since non-English speakers most likely represent immigrants from foreign countries, their relationship with the increasing incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma can not be easily defined. Including non-English speakers could introduce unknown factors that may contribute to the change in the foregut microbiome and decrease the power of this demonstration project.  :::454 GS FLX Titanium:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Esophageal Adenocarcinoma ][1]    * [ Barrett's Esophagus ][2]    * [ GERD ][3]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =Esophageal%20Adenocarcinoma     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68001471[uid]     [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68005764[uid]  :::Study History   Gastroesophageal reflux disorders (GERD) refer to a sequence of diseases arising from gastric reflux, including reflux esophagitis (RE), Barrett's esophagus (intestinal metaplasia) (BE), and its downstream sequelum esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA). The incidence of EA has increased > 6-fold in the U.S. since the 1970s (1), parallel to an increasing prevalence of RE (2). Despite numerous studies, no explanation has been found for the increase. Although prevalence of RE is increasing in both men and women, strong gender disparity with male predominance is obvious at the stages of BE and EA for reasons unknown (3-5). The current strategy for dealing with the continuum of progression of GERD-related problems is limited to passive observation and symptomatic treatment, such as using proton pump inhibitors, and has been ineffective in preventing the increase in the incidence of EA. GERD, similar to other chronic diseases, likely has a multi-factorial etiology. Although host factors likely play a role, such a rapid increase in incidence must be predominantly environmental. Conventional studies have identified numerous risk factors, but their association with GERD is moderate (Table 1). The main factor(s) remain to be identified. The role of the microbiome in the development of inflammation-related cancers has been suggested by recent studies in some mouse models that mimic inflammatory bowel diseases (6). The development of mucosal inflammation and adenocarcinoma requires both a trigger (chemical or genetic) and the presence of commensal bacteria. Although human exposure to several exogenous pathogens has been monitored, there has been little attention paid to changes in the indigenous microbiome. This is partly due to the complexity and difficulties in culture and analysis of the human microbiome.  Among the environmental agents that have been considered are microbes. The human body can be viewed as a superorganism composed of an amalgam of both microbial and Homo sapiens cells. Our relationship with bacteria can be considered to span a broad spectrum, from mutualism to pathogenicity (7). There are currently two theories to explain bacterial diseases. The classic pathogen theory, largely attributed to Koch, requires the presence of specific pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Bacillus anthracis (8). Alternatively, the microecological disease or "pathogenic microbial community" theory is a new concept in which the entire community contributes to pathogenicity although no individual community members can be categorized as classic pathogens (9).  Non-pathogenic bacteria do not have classically defined virulence factors but may harm the host by their basic metabolic activities or structural components. The gut microbiota in ob/ob mice, for example, has an increased capacity to harvest energy from the diet and might play a role in the pathophysiology of obesity (10). Also, a structural component of the gram- negative outer membrane from non-pathogenic bacteria, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), can induce abnormal relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter via activation of the iNOS pathway (11) and (12) delay gastric emptying through the COX-2 pathway. Both effects increase the chance of reflux.  We have endeavored to understand the bacterial-host relationship in GERD in a stepwise way. First, we performed a comprehensive study of the microbiota in the distal esophagus and demonstrated its complexity, despite little prior knowledge (13-14). Surprisingly, the esophageal microbiota is comparable in complexity to those found in the mouth, stomach, colon, vagina, and skin. Collectively, nine phyla were observed, represented by 166 species. The distal esophagus could harbor > 200species, as predicted by the Chao-1 richness estimator. Second, we have demonstrated that in a high-risk population (elderly males) the esophageal microbiota can be classified into two types with the use of both unsupervised and phenotype-directed analyses, and that the type II biota is the strongest (OR >15) amongst all known environmental factors that are associated with the pathological changes related to RE and BE.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Co-Principal Investigators **      * Zhiheng Pei, MD, PhD.

phs000284.v1.p1::: NHLBI Cleveland Family Study (CFS) Candidate Gene Association Resource (CARe):::Study Description   The Cleveland Family Study is the largest family-based study of sleep apnea world-wide, consisting of 2284 individuals (46% African American) from 361 families studied on up to 4 occasions over a period of 16 years. The study was begun in 1990 with the initial aims of quantifying the familial aggregation of sleep apnea. NIH renewals provided expansion of the original cohort (including increased minority recruitment) and longitudinal follow-up, with the last exam occurring in February 2006. Index probands (n=275) were recruited from 3 area hospital sleep labs if they had a confirmed diagnosis of sleep apnea and at least 2 first-degree relatives available to be studied. In the first 5 years of the study, neighborhood control probands (n=87) with at least 2 living relatives available for study were selected at random from a list provided by the index family and also studied. All available first degree relatives and spouses of the case and control probands also were recruited. Second-degree relatives, including half-sibs, aunts, uncles and grandparents, were also included if they lived near the first degree relatives (cases or controls), or if the family had been found to have two or more relatives with sleep apnea. Blood was sampled and DNA isolated for participants seen in the last two exam cycles (n=1447). The sample, which is enriched with individuals with sleep apnea, also contains a high prevalence of individuals with sleep apnea-related traits, including: obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and HTN.  Phenotyping data have been collected over 4 exam cycles, each occurring ~every 4 years. The last three exams targeted all subjects who had been studied at earlier exams, as well as new minority families and family members of previously studied probands who had been unavailable at prior exams. Data from one, two, three and four visits are available for 412, 630, 329 and 67, participants, respectively. In the first 3 exams, participants underwent overnight in-home sleep studies, allowing determination of the number and duration of hypopneas and apneas, sleep period, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels; anthropometry (weight, height, and waist, hip, and neck circumferences); resting blood pressure; spirometry; standardized questionnaire evaluation of symptoms, medications, sleep patterns, quality of life, daytime sleepiness measures and health history; venipuncture and measurement of total and HDL cholesterol. The 4th exam (2001-2006) was designed to collect more detailed measurements of sleep, metabolic and CVD phenotypes and included measurement of state-of-the-art polysomnography, with both collection of blood and measurement of blood pressure before and after sleep, and anthropometry, upper airway assessments, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide, and ECG performed the morning after the sleep study.  Data have been collected by trained research assistants or GCRC nurses following written Manuals of Procedures who were certified following standard approaches for each study procedure. Ongoing data quality, with assessment of within or between individual drift, has been monitored on an ongoing basis, using statistical techniques as well as regular re-certification procedures. Between and within scorer reliabilities for key sleep apnea indices have been excellent, with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) exceeding 0.92 for the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Sleep staging, assessed with epoch specific comparisons, also demonstrate excellent reliability for stage identification (kappas>0.82). There has been no evidence of significant time trends-between or within scorers- for the AHI variables. We also have evaluated the night-to- night variability of the AHI and other sleep variables in 91 subjects, with each measurement made 1-3 months apart. There is high night to night consistency for the AHI (ICC: 0.80), the arousal index (0.76), and the % sleep time in slow-wave sleep (0.73). We have demonstrated the comparability of the apnea estimates (AHI) determined from limited channel studies obtained at in- home settings with in full in-laboratory polysomnography. In addition to our published validation study, we more recently compared the AHI in 169 Cleveland Family Study participants undergoing both assessments (in-home and in- laboratory) within one week apart. These showed excellent levels of agreement (ICC=0.83), demonstrating the feasibility of examining data from either in- home or in-laboratory studies for apnea phenotyping. Data collected in the GCRC were obtained, when possible, with comparable, if not identical techniques, as were the same measures collected at prior exams performed in the participants' homes. To address the comparability of data collected over different exams, we calculated the crude age-adjusted correlations ~3 year within individual correlations between measures made in the most recent GCRC exam with measures made in a prior exam and demonstrated excellent levels of agreement for BMI (r=.91); waist circumference (0.91); FVC (0.88); and FEV1 (0.86). As expected due to higher biological and measurement variability, 149 somewhat lower 3-year correlations were demonstrated for SBP (0.56); Diastolic BP (0.48); AHI (0.62); and nocturnal oxygen desaturation (0.60).  **NHLBI Candidate-gene Association Resource.** The NHLBI initiated the Candidate gene Association Resource (CARe) to create a shared genotype/phenotype resource for analyses of the association of genotypes with phenotypes relevant to the mission of the NHLBI. The resource comprises nine cohort studies funded by the NHLBI including: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Cleveland Family Study (CFS), Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Jackson Heart Study (JHS), Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). A database of genotype and phenotype data was created that includes records for approximately 41,000 study participants with approximately 50,000 SNPs from more than 2,000 selected candidate genes. In addition, a genome wide association study using a 1,000K SNP Chip was conducted on approximately 8,900 African American participants drawn from five CARe cohorts: ARIC, CARDIA, CFS, JHS, and MESA. Data from individual cohorts is available to approved investigators through dbGaP.  **Some relevant CARe publications**  > CARe Study: PMID <a href="http:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20400780" target="_blank">20400780  > CVD Chip Design: PMID <a href="http:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974833" target="_blank">18974833    * Study Weblink: [Cleveland Family Study][1]    * Study Type: Longitudinal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1473  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://dceweb1.case.edu/serc/collab/project_family.shtml  :::Longitudinal::: 1473:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

Exam visits occurred as many as 4 times over a 15 year time interval. Unlike some of the other CARe cohorts, new participants joined the study during subsequent waves of data collection and thus data are available from one to four exams per participant. The variable named VISIT denotes the type of visit and are labeled as VISIT #1 (1990-2001), VISIT #2 (1996-2001), VISIT #3 (1999-2001) and VISIT #5 (2001-2005) (there is no VISIT #4). These visits did not occur in "waves", instead they reflect which visit number was recorded. Recruitment was rolling, thus some individuals had a first visit (VISIT=1) after others had a second or third visit (VISIT = 2 or 3).  The first 3 visits occurred in participants' homes. Individuals who participated in visits 2 and 3 included as many participants who were available for examination from a prior visit. There were also additional family members and new minority families recruited later and recorded as visit 1 or 5, depending on type of data collected. Visit 5 occurred in a dedicated clinical research facility (GCRU). This visit targeted minority families and families in whom a prior microsatellite exam had been conducted (selected for genetic informativity). Data collection for visit 5 was more comprehensive-it generally included prior measurements made as well as more detailed biochemical data, ECGs, endothelial function, and sleep staging data. Thus, the data from VISIT = 5 accounts for the most recent visit for data collected on individuals in the Cleveland Family Study and represents the most complete data collection but only includes data for 735 participants.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Susan Redline, MD.

phs000382.v1.p1::: CIDR Whole Exome Sequencing in Joubert Syndrome:::Study Description   The purpose of this study is to identify new genetic causes of neurodevelopmental diseases (NDDs) in the Joubert syndrome (JS) spectrum. Joubert syndrome is a recessive disease characterized by cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. Our currently funded NINDS award entitled "Molecular characterization of Joubert syndrome" seeks to identify new genetic causes through a variety of molecular strategies. Although our previous strategies involved whole genome SNP-scans, followed by candidate gene sequencing to arrive at identification of new JS causes, we have recently moved to Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) as a highly efficient methodology that is optimized for recessive disease. In this pilot project, CIDR has sequenced DNA on probands from 20 inbred families with JS spectrum disorders in which known causes have been excluded, that have not previously undergone genome-wide SNP scans. These paired end reads will be subject to our established bioinformatics pipeline including HOMOZGYOSITY, SNP and INDEL callers in our lab to identify potentially deleterious sequence changes (PDSC). This is followed by analysis to include testing each PDSC for segregation in the whole pedigree, for occurrence in a ethnically-matched cohort, as well as a defined patient cohort patients, in order to validate new NDD genes.    * Study Types: Cohort, Family, Exome Sequencing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 22  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Cohort, Family, Exome Sequencing::: 22:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

phs000370.v1.p1::: The Mutational Landscape of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma:::Study Description   This study was the first-known large-scale effort to uncover the mutational spectrum of head and neck cancers. We analyzed whole-exome sequence from 92 tumor-normal pairs and retained 74 of them for significance analysis. The majority exhibited a mutational profile consistent with tobacco exposure; human papilloma virus sequence was detectable in 15% of cases. In addition to identifying previously known HNSCC genes (_TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, PIK3CA, and HRAS_), the analysis revealed many genes not previously implicated in this malignancy. At least 30% of cases harbor mutations in genes (such as _NOTCH1, IRF6, TP63_) that regulate squamous differentiation, implicating alterations in this process as a major driver of HNSCC carcinogenesis. Altogether, the results suggest that large-scale exome sequencing may illuminate fundamental tumorigenic mechanisms with important therapeutic implications.    * Study Types: Case Set, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal, Exome Sequencing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 92  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case Set, Tumor vs. Matched-Normal, Exome Sequencing::: 92:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   Connect to the [public download site.][1] The site contains release notes, manifests, documents, data dictionaries, variable summaries, and truncated analyses.

EGAS00000000033::: Geographical structure and differential natural selection among North European populations:::Study Description       European populations and epidemiological cohorts are of special significance in the current era of genomic research aiming to characterize the background of common human diseases. The genome sequence, detailed information of genetic variations between individuals, high-throughput molecular technologies and novel statistical strategies create new possibilities to define genetic and life-style risk factors behind common health problems. Studies of large population cohorts are needed to transform the genetic information to detailed understanding of the predisposing factors in diseases affecting most human populations. European twin cohorts provide a unique competitive advantage for investigations of the role of genetics and environment or life style in the etiology of common diseases. This project will apply and develop new molecular and statistical strategies to analyze unique European twin and other population cohorts to define and characterise the genetic, environmental and life-style components in the background of health problems like obesity, migraine, coronary heart disease and stroke, representing major health care problems worldwide.    * Study Weblink: [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000033][1]    * Study Type: Population    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access:  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000033  :::Population:::0::: ::: ::: ::: ::: :::

Multiple Washington University researchers may be involved in these projects depending upon the phenotypes observed. Sequencing is performed in either of the University's sequencing facilities, the Genome Technology Access Center or the Genome Institute. Corresponding genotyping is performed by the Washington University Clinical and Molecular Cytogenetics Laboratory. The analysis aligns exome data to the human genome followed by variant calling.

phs000440.v1.p1::: Center for Craniofacial and Dental Genetics: Study of Dental Caries and Cleft Lip/Palate in Guatemala:::Study Description   This study provides an opportunity to investigate the genetics of both dental caries and orofacial clefts (OFCs) in one set of families ascertained in Guatemala. This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [http://www.genevastudy.org][1]), which was developed through the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). Furthermore this study brings together multiple research priorities of the University of Pittsburgh Center for Craniofacial and Dental Genetics ([www.ccdg.pitt.edu][2]). A genome-wide panel of 610,000 SNPs was genotyped at the Broad Institute to be comparable to our other pertinent GENEVA studies that are also part of dbGaP (dbGaP accession number [phs000095][3], "Dental Caries: Whole Genome Association and Gene x Environment Studies" and dbGaP accession number [phs000094][4], "International Consortium to Identify Genes and Interactions Controlling Oral Clefts"). The goal of this study is to investigate genetic determinants to dental caries and to OFCs in a novel study population. To date, most genetic studies of dental caries have been conducted in Caucasians, and of OFCs in Caucasians and Asians. The Guatemalan population under study is rural and ethnically mixed with a high proportion of Native- South-Americans.  Thirty-six Guatemalans from this dataset were also part of the recent GWAS studies of cleft lip and cleft palate (Beaty et al., 2010 and 2011, dbGaP Study Accession: [phs000094][4], "International Consortium to Identify Genes and Interactions Controlling Oral Clefts"). In addition to the families ascertained in Guatemala, some subjects were genotyped with this cohort to augment the data in the parent GENEVA study (Dental Caries: Whole Genome Association and Gene x Environment Studies, dbGaP accession number [phs000095][3]), in particular individuals from the IOWA and PITT GENEVA study sites. Their data are available with the parent study.  Dental caries (also known as tooth decay) remains the most common chronic disease of childhood, five times more common than asthma and seven times more common than environmental allergies, with more than 40% of children exhibiting caries when they enter kindergarten. In 2005, it was estimated that dental health care costs were approximately $84 billion, of which 60% or about $50 billion were related to treatment of dental caries. The etiology of dental caries has been studied for many years. Multiple factors contribute to a person's risk for caries, including: 1) environmental factors such as diet, oral hygiene, fluoride exposure and the level of colonization of cariogenic bacteria and 2) host factors such as salivary flow, salivary buffering capacity, position of teeth relative to each other, surface characteristics of tooth enamel and depth of occlusal fissures on posterior teeth. In spite of all that is known about this disease, there are still individuals who appear to be more susceptible to caries and those who are extremely resistant, regardless of the environmental risk factors to which they are exposed, implying that genetic factors also play an important role in caries etiology. This conclusion is supported by studies in both humans and animals, with the most compelling evidence coming from studies of twins reared apart in which investigators found significant resemblance within monozygotic (MZ) but not dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs for percentage of teeth and surfaces restored or carious and estimated the genetic contribution to caries as 40%. Other recent studies of twins reared together estimated the heritability for caries, adjusted for age and gender, as ranging from 45-64%. In our study populations of families, we also estimated caries heritability as approximately 54%-70% of variation in primary dentition caries scores and 35%-55% in the permanent dentition (Wang et al., 2010).  Orofacial clefts (OFCs), particularly cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) and isolated cleft palate (CP) are a major public health problem, affecting one in every 500-1000 births worldwide thus representing the most common facial birth defect and one of the most common of all congenital anomalies. CL/P is a major structural birth defect that is notable for significant lifelong morbidity and complex etiology. The extensive psychological, surgical, speech and dental involvement emphasize the importance of understanding the underlying causes of CL/P. Therefore, many research groups have attempted to elucidate the etiology of CL/P, with some recent success by our research group and others (see Beaty et al., 2010, 2011; Dixon et al., 2011). It is clear that CL/P can occur as part of Mendelian syndromes, that certain chromosomal abnormalities include CL/P in the phenotype, and that certain teratogens can increase the risk of having an offspring with CL/P. However, phenotypes of known etiology comprise only a small portion of all individuals with a CL/P or CP, and the major focus of research into OFCs is to develop an understanding of the etiology of nonsyndromic (NS) forms of clefting. A major focus of the University of Pittsburgh CCDG has been to study additional phenotypes within nonsyndromic OFC families in order to identify sub-clinical expressions of OFC risk genes or risk variants, e.g. SNPs (see Weinberg et al., 2006). A detailed oral exam is conducted as part of these extended phenotypic studies, including a dental caries exam.  Note that although there are some reports in the literature of higher caries experience in individuals with clefts, the most recent meta-analysis of those literature reports concluded that individuals born with these defects do not have a higher frequency of caries (Hasslof and Twetman, 2007). Notably, we investigated the association of CL/P and caries in three of our study populations (including part of the Guatemalan population in this GWAS study) and also found no increase in caries rates of CL/P cases versus controls (Jindal et al., 2011).  This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [http://www.genevastudy.org][1]), which was developed through the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to dental caries and oral clefts through large-scale genome-wide association studies of well- characterized Guatemalan families and individuals. Genotyping was performed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The study was supported by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR, U01-DE018903).

This study is known as the Pittsburgh Orofacial Cleft Study (POFC), which began in 2002 and which has data collection sites in several countries (Guatemala, Hungary, Brazil, Argentina, China, the Philippines) the U.S.A. (Pittsburgh, Texas, Iowa). The goal of POFC is to investigate etiologic factors in Orofacial Clefts (OFCs), particularly nonsyndromic cleft lip and cleft palate (CL/P). The major focus of the study is to understand genetic components contributing to risk of CL/P and to understand the underlying heterogeneity in this group of disorders. As a tool for better understanding CL/P, POFC is conducting extensive phenotyping within families with one or more individuals affected with CL/P, and in control families with no known family history of CL/P. The phenotypes under investigation include a variety of sub-clinical phenotypes that are seen in the general population (and in our study control families) but are seen at an increased frequency in relatives of individuals with CL/P compared to controls (Weinberg et al., 2006; Marazita, 2007). Among these sub-clinical phenotypes are several oral measurements, including assessment of dental caries status. Thus, this GWAS allows studies of CL/P and dental caries in the same study population.  The POFC Guatemala site was started as a partnership with a medical service organization, Children of the Americas ([www.childrenoftheamericas.org][2]), and their associated Guatemalan hospitals. The Guatemalan families under study have been investigated for some candidate genes for dental caries (Deeley et al., 2007) and for several candidate genes for CL/P (e.g. Neiswanger et al., 2006) as well as being part of the recent GWAS studies of cleft lip and cleft palate (Beaty et al., 2010 and 2011). Note that we investigated the association of CL/P and caries in three of the study populations (including part of the Guatemalan population in this GWAS study) and found no increase in caries rates in CL/P cases versus controls (Jindal et al., 2011).

EGAS00000000052::: A Comprehensive Catalogue of Somatic Mutations from a Human Cancer Genome:::Study Description       We have carried out complete sequencing of the genome of the human male maligant melanoma cell line COLO-829 using the Illumina Genome Analyzer II. We generated a sequencing library with a median insert size of ~200 bp following random fragmentation and gel fractionation of the genomic DNA. We sequenced 75 bases from both ends of these templates to cover the COLO-829 genome to an average depth of more than 40x. We have carried out purity-filtering (PF) to remove mixed reads, where two or more different template molecules are close enough on the surface of the flow-cell to form a mixed or overlapping cluster. No other filtering of the data has been carried out prior to submission. We have also submitted sequence data for a lymphoblastoid control cell line COLO- 829BL from the same individual.    * Study Weblink: [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000052][1]    * Study Type: Whole Genome Sequencing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access:  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000052  :::Whole Genome Sequencing:::0::: ::: ::: ::: ::: :::

phs000487.v1.p1::: Functionally Active Copy Number Variants Associated with Prostate Cancer Risk:::Study Description   Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in males throughout the world and has the largest estimated effect of heritability among the most common tumor types. Copy Number Variants (CNVs) are a recently recognized class of human germline polymorphisms (Iafrate AJ, et al. (2004) Nat Genet 36, 949-951; Sebat J, et al. (2004) Science 305, 525-528.) and are associated with a variety of human diseases, including cancer. This study characterized 1,903 individuals from the Tyrol Early Prostate Cancer Detection Program (Bartsch G, et al. (2008) BJU Int 101, 809-816) using a computational framework (Banerjee S, et al. (2011) PLoS One 29;6(3)). The study results establish non-coding and coding germline CNVs as significant risk factors for prostate cancer susceptibility and implicate their role in disease development and progression.

phs000533.v1.p1::: National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI): Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma - Follicular Lymphoma (NHL - FL):::Study Description   The Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG) at the National Cancer Institute is sponsoring a series of studies as part of the Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI) to assess novel emerging sequencing technologies in cancer. The CGCI program includes comprehensive characterization of the genetic aberrations found in different pediatric and/or adult tumors. CGCI is currently characterizing a number of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and adult and pediatric Burkitt lymphomas).  In combination, the lymphoid cancers (non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia), constitute the fourth most common malignancy in both men and women in North America. Lymphomas typically have characteristic abnormal chromosomes, including translocations, indicating the relevance of mutations to how NHLs develop and behave. This project uses detailed analysis on a specific well-characterized set of tumors to provide a candidate list of genomic changes specific to and common across lymphoma types. The resulting data set will facilitate studies of clinical behavior, response to treatment, patient outcome and survival, and target pathways for therapeutic agents.  CGCI investigators are probing genomic alterations more deeply than has been previously possible by using state-of-the-art RNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) and whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) coupled with leading edge bioinformatics, data management and analysis approaches. Specifically, 2nd- generation sequencing technologies are used to survey NHL for somatic mutations, chromosomal alterations and expression levels. Fresh-frozen biopsy material and constitutional DNA is assembled from uniformly staged, treated and followed NHL patients in British Columbia, Canada. To date the project has sequenced tumor DNA and/or RNA from 117 NHL tumor samples and 10 cell lines. This includes the genomes or exomes of 1 Follicular Lymphoma (FL) and 13 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cases, all with matched constitutional DNA sequenced to comparable depths, RNA-sequencing (mRNA-seq) of 92 DLBCL, 12 FL and 8 B-cell NHL cases with other histologies and 10 DLBCL-derived cell lines. The DLBCL cases and cell-lines are from the two major subtypes of DLBCL: germinal center B-cell (GCB) and activated B-cell (ABC).    * Study Weblink: [The Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative][1]    * Study Type: Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 13  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/cgci.html  :::Cohort::: 13:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000235.v4.p1.**     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000235  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   All specimens and all clinical and laboratory data gathered for this project meet the strict set of criteria established by [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)][1].

phs000528.v1.p1::: National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI): HIV+ Tumor Molecular Characterization Project - Cervical Cancer (HTMCP - CC):::Study Description   The Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG) at the National Cancer Institute is sponsoring a series of studies as part of the Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI) to assess novel emerging sequencing technologies in cancer. The CGCI program includes comprehensive characterization of the genetic aberrations found in different pediatric and/or adult tumors. All data from these projects will be released into publicly accessible databases, with a majority of data in an open-access tier. A subset of data will be available only through a controlled-access tier due to patient privacy concerns.  CGCI is currently characterizing a number of HIV-associated tumors (including DLBCL, lung and cervical cancers). As part of CGCI, this project is a joint effort of the Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG) and the Office of HIV and AIDS Malignancy (OHAM). Its goals are to characterize HIV-associated cancers (obtained from HIV-infected patients) and compare them to the same types of cancers from patients without HIV infection.  By the end of 2003, approximately 1.2 million people living in the US were infected with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus: the precursor for AIDS or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). The global prevalence of HIV infection is approximately 40 million. People infected with HIV have an elevated risk of cancer and mortality, and cancer is a ranking cause of death among people with HIV/AIDS. It is important to understand why certain cancers, but not others, are increased in patients with HIV infection. Even though many HIV-associated cancers have a viral etiology, and immunodeficiency is believed to provide a permissive environment for viral oncogenesis, many questions remain even for those tumors that are induced by oncogenic viruses.  The Genome Sciences Center at the British Columbia Cancer Agency will perform 30X genome sequencing of 100 cases of paired tumor and germline DNA, along with transcriptome sequencing of HIV+ tumors. These platforms allow discovery of mutations both in coding and non-coding genomic regions, gene expression and genomic alterations (including translocations, insertions and deletions). Comparing tumors of cancer patients both with and without HIV-infection will provide insight into the potential function of this virus in certain cancers.  Cervical cancer, a type of cancer that slowly forms in tissues of the cervix, is almost always caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. So far, there have been an estimated 4,290 deaths due to cervical cancer this year. In a thorough evaluation of various HPV-related malignancies, cervical cancer was selected for study based on its impact on mortality and on the prevalence of high quality source tissue.    * Study Weblink: [The Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative][1]    * Study Type: Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 0  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/cgci.html  :::Cohort::: 0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000235.v4.p1.**     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000235  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   All specimens and all clinical and laboratory data gathered for this project meet the strict set of criteria established by [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)][1].

Over its lifetime, it accrued nearly 11,000 patients up to the age of 31 years with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Both B-precursor and T-lineage patients, as well as rare subsets of bi-phenotypic patients were eligible. Patients were encouraged to simultaneously enroll on therapeutic studies, and greater than 90% of them did. AALL03B1 collected clinical data at diagnosis as well as lymphoblast genetic features and a patient's response to therapy in their bone marrow on day 8 and 15 of the first month of therapy (induction) as well as in their bone marrow on day 29 using flow cytometry. After reviewing this data together, the patients were subsequently stratified to different arms of several clinical trials in order to intensify therapy according to a predicted risk of relapse. Remission DNA was collected at day 29 from peripheral blood samples (__Note:_ the only time the peripheral blood might not be considered a true control is if the patient did not achieve either a clinical, morphologic, or MRD negative remission_). The inclusion criteria for Phase II of the TARGET ALL project were those patients who had experienced an early bone marrow relapse (most were < 3 years, all < 4 years, from the time of diagnosis) and who had available diagnostic and remission material. When possible, specimens at the time of relapse were also studied.  ::: :::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ][1]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68054198[uid]  :::Study History   Pediatric ALL was the first disease to be piloted for the TARGET initiative, which is jointly managed by the NCI Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG) and Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP).

We identified associations with 77 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning 12.5 megabases (Mb) on chromosome 6q26-q27 that met criteria for genome-wide significance (p  1.3 x 10-7), and were within or flanking nine genes, including LPA. We show that variation in at least six genes in addition to LPA are significantly associated with Lp(a) levels independent of each other and of the kringle IV repeat polymorphism in the LPA gene. One novel SNP in intron 37 of the LPA gene was also associated with Lp(a) levels and carotid artery disease number in unrelated Caucasians (p = 7.3 x 10-12 and 0.024, respectively), also independent of kringle IV number. This study suggests a complex genetic architecture of Lp(a) levels that may involve multiple loci on chromosome 6q26-q27.    * Study Type: Population    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 386  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Population::: 386:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000185.v1.p1.**     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000185  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   Individuals living in 9 Hutterite colonies who are age 15 and older and were not on cholesterol lowering medications at the time of the Phase 1 studies (1996-1997) were included.  :::Mapping250K_Nsp;Mapping250K_Sty;nsSNP Custom Array:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Cardiovascular Diseases ][1]    * [ Carotid Artery Diseases ][2]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68002318[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68002340[uid]  ::: :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Carole Ober.

Summary level phenotypes for the Cardiovascular Health Study Cohort study participants can be viewed at the top-level study page phs000287 Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) Cohort. Individual level phenotype data and molecular data for the Cardiovascular Health Study top-level study and substudies are available by requesting Authorized Access to the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) Cohort study [phs000287][4].**  **Objectives:**  The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is a study of risk factors for development and progression of CHD and stroke in people aged 65 years and older. The objectives of the Cardiovascular Health Study are to: 1) quantify associations of conventional and hypothesized risk factors with CHD and stroke; 2) assess the associations of non-invasive measures of subclinical disease with the incidence of CHD and stroke; 3) quantify the associations of risk factors with subclinical disease; 4) characterize the natural history of CHD and stroke, and identify factors associated with clinical course; and 5) describe the prevalence and distributions of risk factors, non-invasive measures of subclinical disease, and clinical CHD and stroke.  **Background:**  The study originated in 1988 from the recommendations of an NHLBI workshop on the management of CHD in the elderly. This is the most extensive study undertaken by the NHLBI to study CVD exclusively in an elderly population. Initially funded for six years, it was renewed for a second six year period in 1994 and recently was renewed for continued morbidity and mortality follow-up.  **Subjects:**  The 5,888 study participants were recruited from four U.S. communities and have undergone extensive clinic examinations for evaluation of markers of subclinical cardiovascular disease. The original cohort totaled 5,201 participants. A new cohort was recruited in 1992. The 687 participants in the new cohort are predominately African-American and were recruited at three of the four field centers.  **Design:**  The 2,962 women and 2,239 men were examined yearly from 1989 through 1999. The added minority cohort of 256 men and 431 women was examined from 1992 to 1999. Examination components have included medical history questionnaires, measurement of ankle-brachial index, abdominal and carotid ultrasound studies, echocardiograms, ambulatory electrocardiograms, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, spirometry and retinal photographs over the past decade. The most extensive evaluations were at study entry (baseline) and again in 1992-1993 to assess change in subclinical disease measures. CHS has undertaken extensive follow-up for ascertainment of cardiovascular events including incident claudication, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke and death.  **NHLBI Candidate-gene Association Resource.** The NHLBI initiated the Candidate gene Association Resource (CARe) to create a shared genotype/phenotype resource for analyses of the association of genotypes with phenotypes relevant to the mission of the NHLBI. The resource comprises nine cohort studies funded by the NHLBI including: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Cleveland Family Study (CFS), Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Jackson Heart Study (JHS), Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). A database of genotype and phenotype data was created that includes records for approximately 41,000 study participants with approximately 50,000 SNPs from more than 2,000 selected candidate genes. In addition, a genome wide association study using a 1,000K SNP Chip was conducted on approximately 8,900 African American participants drawn from five CARe cohorts: ARIC, CARDIA, CFS, JHS, and MESA. Data from individual cohorts is available to approved investigators through dbGaP.  **Some relevant CARe publications**  > CARe Study: PMID <a href="http:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20400780" target="_blank">20400780  > CVD Chip Design: PMID <a href="http:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974833" target="_blank">18974833    * Study Weblink: [CHS][5]    * Study Type: Longitudinal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 0  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000377.v1.p1     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [3]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=CHSAcknowledgement.pdf     [4]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000287     [5]: http://www.chs-nhlbi.org/default.htm  :::Longitudinal::: 0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000287.v2.p1.**     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000287  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   Participants aged 65 and older were recruited from random samples of Medicare eligibility lists in four communities: Sacramento County, California; Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and from age-eligible participants in the same household.

phs000281.v4.p2::: NHLBI GO-ESP: Women&#39;s Health Initiative Exome Sequencing Project (WHI) - WHISP:::Study Description   ** Important Links and Information **    * [Data Use Certification Agreement][1]    * [Apply for Authorized Access ][2]    * [Acknowledgement Statements][3]  This substudy phs000281 WHISP contains exome sequencing, produced as part of NHLBI's GO-ESP project. Summary level phenotypes for the WHI Cohort study participants can be viewed at the top-level study page [phs000200][4] WHI Cohort. Individual level phenotype data and molecular data for all WHI top- level study and substudies are available by requesting Authorized Access to the WHI Cohort study [phs000200][4].  The NHLBI "Grand Opportunity" Exome Sequencing Project (GO-ESP), a signature project of the NHLBI Recovery Act investment, was designed to identify genetic variants in coding regions (exons) of the human genome (the "exome") that are associated with heart, lung and blood diseases. These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied. These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease, contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention and treatments to specific populations. This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects. GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers - BroadGO and SeattleGO.  **Women's Health Initiative:**  The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) is a long-term national health study that has focused on strategies for preventing heart disease, breast and colorectal cancer, and osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women. The original WHI study included 161,808 postmenopausal women enrolled between 1993 and 1998. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA serves as the WHI Clinical Coordinating Center for data collection, management, and analysis of the WHI.  The WHI has two major parts: a partial factorial randomized Clinical Trial (CT) and a longitudinal cohort Observational Study (OS); both were conducted at 40 Clinical Centers nationwide. The CT enrolled 68,132 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50-79 into trials testing three prevention strategies. If eligible, women could choose to enroll in one, two, or all three of the trial components. The components are:    * Hormone Therapy Trials (HT): This component examined the effects of combined hormones or estrogen alone on the prevention of coronary heart disease and osteoporotic fractures, and associated risk for breast cancer. Women participating in this component took hormone pills or a placebo (inactive pill) until the Estrogen plus Progestin and Estrogen Alone trials were stopped early in July 2002 and March 2004, respectively. All HT participants continued to be followed without intervention until close-out.    * Dietary Modification Trial (DM): The Dietary Modification component evaluated the effect of a low-fat and high fruit, vegetable and grain diet on the prevention of breast and colorectal cancers and coronary heart disease. Study participants followed either their usual eating pattern or a low-fat dietary pattern.    * Calcium/Vitamin D Trial (CaD): This component began 1 to 2 years after a woman joined one or both of the other clinical trial components. It evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. Women in this component took calcium and vitamin D pills or a placebo.    * The Observational Study (OS) examines the relationship between lifestyle, health and risk factors and specific disease outcomes. This component involves tracking the medical history and health habits of 93,676 women. Recruitment for the observational study was completed in 1998 and participants were followed for 8 to 12 years. The original protocol allowed for follow-up until March 2005, after which participants were invited to enroll in the WHI Extension Study for follow-up through 2010. As of August 2009 there were 115,406 women enrolled in the WHI Extension Study.  **WHI Sequencing Project (WHISP) / Exome Sequencing Project (ESP)**  In 2010, genetic samples from WHI participants were sequenced for WHISP for inclusion in the dbGaP as part of the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP). The goal of the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) is to discover novel genes and mechanisms contributing to heart, lung and blood disorders by pioneering the application of next-generation sequencing of the protein coding regions of the human genome across diverse, richly-phenotyped populations and to share these datasets and findings with the scientific community to extend and enrich the diagnosis, management and treatment of heart, lung and blood disorders.  Samples are being selected from both arms of the parent WHI study. WHISP will include sampling for case-control status in clinical outcomes, extreme tail sampling for quantitative traits, and random cohort sampling for a deeply phenotyped reference sample.    * Study Weblinks: [Scientific Resources Website: Women's Health Initiative][5]; [NHLBI Women's Health Initiative][6]; [NHLBI GO ESP Project][7]    * Study Types: Partial Factorial Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo- Controlled, Cohort, Longitudinal, Exome Sequencing    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 2150  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000281.v4.p2     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [3]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=WHIAcknowledgement.pdf     [4]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000200     [5]: http://www.whiscience.org     [6]: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/whi     [7]: https://esp.gs.washington.edu/drupal/  :::Partial Factorial Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Cohort, Longitudinal, Exome Sequencing::: 2150:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000200.v8.p2.**     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000200  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   **Women's Health Initiative:**  > Women were eligible for WHI participation if they were between 50 and 79 years of age, postmenopausal, likely to live in the area for 3 years and have no condition predicting survival &lt; 3 years.

phs000342.v6.p7::: NHLBI Framingham SNP Health Association Resource (SHARe):::Study Description   This substudy phs000342 Framingham SHARe contains 100K and 550K genotypes, produced as part of NHLBI's SNP Health Association Resource (SHARe) project. It also contains 4.3 million genotypes produced under Illumina's Fast Track Genotyping Service. Summary level phenotypes for the Framingham Cohort study participants can be viewed at the top-level study page [phs000007][1] Framingham Cohort. Individual level phenotype data and molecular data for all Framingham top-level study and substudies are available by requesting Authorized Access to the Framingham Cohort study [phs000007][1].  **Framingham Heart Study SHARe Genome-Wide Association Study.** In 2007, the FHS entered a new phase with the conduct of genotyping for the FHS SHARe project, for which genotyping was conducted using approximately 550,000 SNPs (Affymetrix 500K mapping array plus Affymetrix 50K supplemental array) in over 9,300 subjects from the three generations of subjects (including over 1500 families). The SHARe database is housed at NCBI's dbGaP and contains all 550,000 SNPs as well as SNP and microsatellite genotyping conducted previously in the FHS.  **100K Genome-Wide Association Study and Results Browser.** A subset of 1345 adult participants (original cohort and offspring) of the largest 310 pedigrees in the FHS, many biologically related, was genotyped with the 100K Affymetrix GeneChip. These genotypes were used to assess their contribution to a wide range of traits collected in FHS over 59 years of follow up, including: cardiovascular risk factors and biomarkers; subclinical and clinical cardiovascular disease; cancer and longevity traits; and traits in pulmonary, sleep, neurology, renal, and bone domains. Genome-wide variance component linkage and population and family-based association tests were conducted. An overview manuscript, as well as 17 manuscripts describing the unreplicated results of analyses of the various phenotypes, was published in a supplement of BMC Medical Genetics in September 2007. A link to the full disclosure results of these analyses is available through dbGaP on the Analyses page.  **Illumina HumanOmni5M-4v1 Array.** In 2011, genotyping of approximately 4.3 million SNPs was conducted in subset of 2500 Framingham Offspring Cohort participants using the Illumina HumanOmni5M-4v1 array designed to target variation down to 1% minor allele frequency. This genotyping was produced at no charge by Illumina under an agreement between Illumina and Boston University.    * Study Weblink: [The Framingham Heart Study][2]    * Study Type: Longitudinal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 9278  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000007     [2]: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/framingham/index.html  :::Longitudinal::: 9278:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000007.v18.p7.**     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000007  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   [A description of the Design of the Original Cohort][1] can be found at Dawber TR, Meadors GF, and Moore FEJ.

phs000534.v1.p1::: National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI): Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG) Grants - RC1 Human Lung Carcinogenesis:::Study Description   The Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG) at the National Cancer Institute is sponsoring a series of studies as part of the Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI), and other grants administered by OCG, to assess novel emerging sequencing technologies in cancer. The CGCI program includes comprehensive characterization of the genetic aberrations found in different pediatric and/or adult tumors.  This Challenge Grant (RC1) proposal represents a discovery phase effort. The investigators hypothesize that a transcriptome- and epigenome-wide search among histologically divergent lung epithelial phenotypes will reveal candidate lung carcinogenesis marks, some of which will be confirmed by high resolution assays as key regulatory loci underlying lung carcinogenesis. Investigators will pursue the identification of transcriptome and epigenome loci that categorize to pathologically-confirmed normal, dysplastic, and malignant epithelial phenotypes in an intra-individual comparison. Initial discovery transcriptome, and epigenome-wide marks of possible phenotypic significance will be verified and refined with high density epigenetic reference techniques. This will allow identification of phenotype-defining epigenome marks at the level of DNA methylation patterns and individual microRNA expression detail. The completion of this set of proposed epigenome- tissue phenotype comparisons could suggest a new set of regulatory pathways in lung carcinogenesis. This in turn will yield candidate pathway approaches to be pursued in future prospective biomarker studies aimed at risk assessment, early diagnosis, and targeted therapies. For the genome-wide phases, the surgically-resected, snap frozen human lung tumor and adjacent nontumor tissues from >25 donors have already been accrued by the Spivack laboratory under other funding mechanisms. For initial gene expression changes: (1) mRNA levels will be surveyed using expression microarrays, and then verified by laboratory-developed RNA-specific mRNA-PCR. For assaying the epigenome, we will employ: (2) Methylome-wide HpaII tiny fragment Enrichment Ligation- mediated PCR (HELP-seq by massively parallel sequencing) assay, with phenotype-differentiating loci verified by deeper sequencing using mass spectroscopy-based sequencing (MassArray) and re-verified at key loci using the laboratory-developed tagged bisulfite genomic sequencing (tBGS). For assaying the micronome, we will employ: (3) MicroRNA-seq by parallel sequencing, verified by both microRNA-qPCR and microRNA pull-down as developed in the Spivack laboratory.    * Study Weblink: [The Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative][1]    * Study Type: Case Set    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 0  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/cgci.html  :::Case Set::: 0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000235.v4.p1.**     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000235  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   Information on specimen inclusion and exclusion criteria for the specific tumor types investigated as part of CGCI can be found on the [CGCI website][1] and within referenced publications for this initiative.

Alterations at the DNA level drive the cellular changes that are hallmarks of cancer including aberrant cell division and survival. Historically, genetic causes of cancer were studied by analysis of one or a few genes at a time. More recently however, novel high-throughput technologies have provided unprecedented capabilities to examine the cancer genome. These technologies allow systematic characterization of genetic and epigenetic alterations, allowing investigators to identify the underlying genetic changes found in cancer. The CGCI incorporates multiple approaches for genomic characterization including exome sequencing and transcriptome analysis using next generation sequencing. To encourage collaboration and leverage the collective knowledge and innovation of the entire cancer research community, all data collected will be publicly available through databases supported by the National Institutes of Health and National Cancer Institute.  The work for this RC1 grant has been completed on 24-32 cases depending upon the characterization platform. This data has been generated as a result of an ongoing case-only series, comparing flash frozen in OR non-small cell lung cancers to paired, far-adjacent lung tissue, both derived from the same individual subjects.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Simon Spivack, MD, MPH.

phs000529.v1.p1::: National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI): HIV+ Tumor Molecular Characterization Project - Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (HTMCP - DLBCL):::Study Description   The Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG) at the National Cancer Institute is sponsoring a series of studies as part of the Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI) to assess novel emerging sequencing technologies in cancer. The CGCI program includes comprehensive characterization of the genetic aberrations found in different pediatric and/or adult tumors. All data from these projects will be released into publicly accessible databases, with a majority of data in an open-access tier. A subset of data will be available only through a controlled-access tier due to patient privacy concerns.  CGCI is currently characterizing a number of HIV-associated tumors (including DLBCL, lung and cervical cancers), as well as B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas in non-HIV+ patients (including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) adult and pediatric Burkitt lymphomas); additional tumor types to be characterized in the future. As part of CGCI, this project is a joint effort of the Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG) and the Office of HIV and AIDS Malignancy (OHAM). Its goals are to characterize HIV-associated cancers (obtained from HIV-infected patients) and compare them to the same types of cancers from patients without HIV infection.  By the end of 2003, approximately 1.2 million people living in the US were infected with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus: the precursor for AIDS or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). The global prevalence of HIV infection is approximately 40 million. People infected with HIV have an elevated risk of cancer and mortality, and cancer is a ranking cause of death among people with HIV/AIDS. It is important to understand why certain cancers, but not others, are increased in patients with HIV infection. Even though many HIV-associated cancers have a viral etiology, and immunodeficiency is believed to provide a permissive environment for viral oncogenesis, many questions remain even for those tumors that are induced by oncogenic viruses.  The Genome Sciences Center at the British Columbia Cancer Agency will perform 30X genome sequencing of 100 cases of paired tumor and germline DNA, along with transcriptome sequencing of HIV+ tumors. These platforms allow discovery of mutations both in coding and non-coding genomic regions, gene expression and genomic alterations (including translocations, insertions and deletions). Comparing tumors of cancer patients both with and without HIV-infection will provide insight into the potential function of this virus in certain cancers.  Incidence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is significantly increased among HIV-positive patients; a trend that continues to rise despite highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A significant proportion of these malignancies are not known to be caused by an oncogenic DNA virus, resulting in many questions about both its pathogenesis and high rate of incidence associated with HIV infection.    * Study Weblink: [The Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative][1]    * Study Type: Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 3  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/cgci.html  :::Cohort::: 3:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000235.v4.p1.**     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000235  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   All specimens and all clinical and laboratory data gathered for this project meet the strict set of criteria established by [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)][1].

phs000499.v1.p1::: NHLBI Jackson Heart Study Candidate Gene Association Resource (CARe):::Study Description   This sub-study [phs000499][1] JHS_CARe contains genotype and selected phenotype of subjects available from the [phs000499][1] study. Summary level phenotypes for the NHLBI JHS Cohort study participants can be viewed at the top-level study page [phs000286][2] JHS Cohort. Individual level phenotype data and molecular data for all JHS Cohort top-level study and sub-study are available by requesting Authorized Access to the NHLBI JHS Cohort [phs000286][2] study.  The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) is a large, community-based, observational study whose participants were recruited from urban and rural areas of the three counties (Hinds, Madison and Rankin) that make up the Jackson, Mississippi, metropolitan statistical area (MSA). Participants were enrolled from each of 4 recruitment pools: random, 17%; volunteer, 30%; currently enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, 22% and secondary family members, 31%. Recruitment was limited to non-institutionalized adult African Americans 35-84 years old, except in the family cohort where those 21 to 34 years of age were eligible. The final cohort of 5,301 participants includes 6.59% of all African American Jackson MSA residents aged 35-84 (N-76,426, US Census 2000). Major components of each exam include medical history, physical examination, blood/urine analytes and interview questions on areas such as: physical activity; stress, coping and spirituality; racism and discrimination; socioeconomic position; and access to health care. At 12-month intervals after the baseline clinic visit (Exam 1), participants are contacted by telephone to: update information; confirm vital statistics; document interim medical events, hospitalizations, and functional status; and obtain additional sociocultural information. Questions about medical events, symptoms of cardiovascular disease and functional status are repeated annually. Ongoing cohort surveillance includes abstraction of medical records and death certificates for relevant International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and adjudication of nonfatal events and deaths.  **NHLBI Candidate-gene Association Resource.** The NHLBI initiated the Candidate gene Association Resource (CARe) to create a shared genotype/phenotype resource for analyses of the association of genotypes with phenotypes relevant to the mission of the NHLBI. The resource comprises nine cohort studies funded by the NHLBI including: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Cleveland Family Study (CFS), Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Jackson Heart Study (JHS), Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). A database of genotype and phenotype data was created that includes records for approximately 41,000 study participants with approximately 50,000 SNPs from more than 2,000 selected candidate genes. In addition, a genome wide association study using a 1,000K SNP Chip was conducted on approximately 8,900 African American participants drawn from five CARe cohorts: ARIC, CARDIA, CFS, JHS, and MESA. Data from individual cohorts is available to approved investigators through dbGaP.  **Some relevant CARe publications**  > CARe Study: PMID <a href="http:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20400780" target="_blank">20400780  > CVD Chip Design: PMID <a href="http:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974833" target="_blank">18974833    * Study Weblink: [Jackson Heart Study][3]    * Study Type: Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 0  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap?term=phs000499     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap?term=phs000286     [3]: http://jhs.jsums.edu/jhsinfo/Default.aspx  :::Cohort::: 0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000286.v3.p1.**     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000286  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   Recruitment was limited to non-institutionalized adult African Americans 35-84 years old, except in the family cohort where those 21 to 34 years of age were eligible.  :::AFFY_6.0;CVDSNP55v1_A::: ::: :::Study Attribution     * ** CARe Project Officers **      * George Papanicolaou, PhD.

phs000527.v1.p1::: National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI): Burkitt Lymphoma Genome Sequencing Project (BLGSP):::Study Description   The Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG) at the National Cancer Institute is sponsoring a series of studies as part of the Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI) to assess novel emerging sequencing technologies in cancer. The CGCI program includes comprehensive characterization of the genetic aberrations found in different pediatric and/or adult tumors. All data from these projects will be released into publicly accessible databases, with a majority of data in an open-access tier. A subset of data will be available only through a controlled-access tier due to patient privacy concerns.  The Burkitt Lymphoma Genome Sequencing Project (BLGSP) is a collaborative effort between the National Cancer Institute and the Foundation for Burkitt Lymphoma Research to develop a databank of the many alterations found in Burkitt lymphoma (BL), an uncommon type of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs most often in children and young adults. Current chemotherapy regimens for BL are effective in approximately 40-90% of patients, depending on age, stage of the disease, treatment regimen, and site of the treatment facility. Hence, new treatments are needed to improve the efficacy of current regimens and to potentially substitute less toxic agents for the high intensity chemotherapeutic drugs currently given.  The goal of the BLGSP is to explore potential genetic changes in patients with BL that could lead to better prevention, detection and treatment of the cancer. OCG will provide the administrative and analytical infrastructure needed to carry out this project based on lessons learned in managing other major cancer genomics projects. The BLGSP will include adult and pediatric patients with sporadic BL, as well as those with endemic and HIV-positive sporadic BL.  The first major objective of the BLGSP is to accrue tumor and patient-matched control tissues obtained by precise protocols from a relatively large number of clinically well-annotated cases of BL. It is anticipated that this phase of the project may take up to two years. The second objective will be to characterize the alterations of the tumors' genomes (with matched normal as control) and transcriptomes by sequencing the DNA and RNA of each case. Using the data generated, the ultimate goals of the project are to discover the molecular changes that are present in BL patients and then determine how those changes correlate with treatment regimen and outcome. Data generated from the BLGSP will be submitted to publicly accessible databases for use by the cancer research community.    * Study Weblink: [The Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative][1]    * Study Type: Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 0  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/cgci.html  :::Cohort::: 0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000235.v4.p1.**     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000235  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   All specimens and all clinical and laboratory data gathered for this project meet the strict set of criteria established by [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)][1].

phs000420.v3.p2::: NHLBI Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) SNP Health Association Resource (SHARe):::Study Description   ** Important Links and Information **    * [Data Use Certification Agreement][1]    * [Apply for Authorized Access ][2]    * [Acknowledgement Statements][3]  This substudy phs000420 MESA SHARe contains Affy 6.0 genotypes, produced as part of NHLBI's SNP Health Association Resource (SHARe) project. Summary level phenotypes for the MESA Cohort study participants can be viewed at the top- level study page [phs000209][4] MESA Cohort. Individual level phenotype data and molecular data for all MESA top-level study and substudies are available by requesting Authorized Access to the MESA Cohort study [phs000209][4].  The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) contribution to the SNP Health Association Resource (SHARe) Project involves the primary MESA Study (also referred to herein as MESA Classic), newly recruited members of the MESA Family ancillary study cohort, and newly recruited members of the MESA Air Pollution ancillary study cohort. MESA Classic and the two ancillary studies recruited large numbers of subjects, collected biological samples, and gathered extensive phenotype data. These MESA cohorts are perhaps unique among NHLBI cohort studies in combining a highly multi-ethnic cohort (European American, African American, Hispanic American, and Chinese American) recruitment with extremely detailed phenotyping related to subclinical cardiovascular disease. It is these samples and phenotype data that create the MESA SHARe data resource. Additionally, phenotype data from a growing number of MESA ancillary studies are added quarterly to the SHARe data resource.  MESA SHARe extends genome wide SNP genotyping to non-African American MESA Classic participants and includes MESA Family and MESA Air, for a total of 8402 total participants. About one millions SNPs, plus copy number variants are typed using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0. Existing GWA data for MESA Classic African American participants, genotyped through the CARe project, were merged with the MESA SHARe data. Genotyping was completed by Affymetrix in September 2009 and released on dbGaP in February 2010.

phs000363.v5.p7::: SABRe CVD Microarray Gene Expression Offspring Cohort Exam 8:::Study Description   This substudy phs000363 Framingham SABRe contains immunoassays, gene expression profiling, and microRNA data. Summary level phenotypes for the Framingham Cohort study participants can be viewed at the top-level study page [phs000007][1] Framingham Cohort. Individual level phenotype data and molecular data for all Framingham top-level study and substudies are available by requesting Authorized Access to the Framingham Cohort study [phs000007][1].  **_S_ystems _A_pproach to _B_iomarker _Re_search in Cardiovascular Disease in the NHLBI's Framingham Heart Study: The SABRe CVD Initiative**  The NHLBI's Framingham Heart Study (FHS), one of the world's preeminent observational study settings, is devoted to increasing scientific knowledge by establishing a public resource of data and samples. For nearly 60 years, the people of Framingham have generously volunteered their time to this high- profile study and remain deeply committed to its success. The _S_ystems _A_pproach to _B_iomarker _Re_search in Cardiovascular Disease Initiative (SABRe CVD Initiative) will generate extensive biomarker data from 7000 FHS participants using multiple high throughput platforms including immunoassays, proteomics, metabolomics/lipomics, and gene expression and microRNA profiling. SABRe will generate thousands of new biomarkers from each participant, with data deposited with the NCBI and linked to the extensive phenotype and genotype data already in an NCBI data repository (as part of the NHLBI SHARe Genome-wide Association Project). All data from the SABRe, SHARe, and the nearly 60 years of phenotypic data from the FHS will be integrated into a massive resource that will be accessible to the outside scientific community in a manner consistent with the informed consent preferences of the Framingham participants.  SABRe CVD Projects    * Project 1: Discovery proteomics and metabolomics/lipomics in case-control studies of subclinical atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome (300 cases, 300 controls), and predicting new cardiovascular events using samples obtained prior to event (150 cases, 300 controls).    * Project 2: Immunoassays of 180 circulating protein biomarkers of atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome in 7400 FHS participants.    * Project 3: Gene expression profiling of WBC derived RNA to characterize the genomic signatures of atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome in 5000-7000 FHS participants (lab work to take place at NHLBI Core Microarray Lab).    * Project 4: MicroRNA profiling of WBC derived RNA to characterize microRNA regulation of gene expression and the relations of microRNA to clinical traits and diseases. microRNA profiling will be conducted in 5000-7000 FHS participants.  The SABRe Initiative is a state-of-the-art research enterprise to advance personalized medicine through biomarker discovery and validation. This project holds great promise for identifying mechanisms of disease and promoting the development of new diagnostics and therapeutics for diseases of high impact.  The specific aims for SABRe CVD are as follows:  > 1. <u>To identify the biomarker signatures of atherosclerosis as determined by<u>: a) aortic and coronary calcification on CT (data available in 3500 people), b) aortic plaque burden by MRI (n=2000), c) carotid intimal-medial thickness by ultrasound (n=3500), d) clinical atherosclerotic CVD (n=500), and e) the dynamic balance between arterial calcification and bone demineralization (n=3500).  2. _To identify the biomarker signatures of metabolic risk factors related to cardiovascular risk_: a) systolic and diastolic blood pressure (n=7000), b) body mass index (n=7000) and visceral adiposity by CT (n=3500), c) dyslipidemia (lipid levels, n=7000), and d) impaired fasting glucose, diabetes, and insulin resistance (glucose and insulin levels, n=7000).  3. _To identify genomic convergence_ (convergence of signals from genetic variation and gene expression) with SABRe biomarker levels and clinical traits and diseases.  **Available Data sets**  Currently we have the following data SABRe CVD data sets available in the 'Authorized Access' area of dbGaP.  **Project 1:**  > We have no data officially posted at this time.

phs000296.v1.p2::: NHLBI GO-ESP: Lung Cohorts Exome Sequencing Project (COPDGene):::Study Description   This sub-study phs000296 ESP LungGO COPDGene contains genotype derived from sequence data and selected phenotype of subjects available from the [phs000179][1] study. Summary level phenotypes for the NHLBI COPDGene Cohort study participants can be viewed at the top-level study page [phs000179][1] COPDGene Cohort. Individual level phenotype data and molecular data for all COPDGene Cohort top-level study and sub-study are available by requesting Authorized Access to the NHLBI COPDGene Cohort [phs000179][1] study.  The NHLBI "Grand Opportunity" Exome Sequencing Project (GO-ESP), a signature project of the NHLBI Recovery Act investment, was designed to identify genetic variants in coding regions (exons) of the human genome (the "exome") that are associated with heart, lung and blood diseases. These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied. These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease, contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention and treatments to specific populations. This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects. GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers - BroadGO and SeattleGO.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and the only leading cause of death that is steadily increasing in frequency. This project will establish a racially diverse cohort that is sufficiently large and appropriately designed for genome-wide association analysis of COPD. A total of 10,000 subjects will be recruited, including control smokers, definite COPD cases (GOLD Stage 2 to 4), and subjects not included in either group (GOLD 1 or GOLD-Unclassified). This cohort will be used for cross-sectional analysis, although long-term longitudinal follow-up will be a future goal. The primary focus of the study will be genome-wide association analysis to identify the genetic risk factors that determine susceptibility for COPD and COPD-related phenotypes. Detailed phenotyping of both cases and controls, including chest CT scan assessment of emphysema and airway disease, will allow identification of genetic determinants for the heterogeneous components of the COPD syndrome. **The hypotheses to be studied are: 1) Precise phenotypic characterization of COPD subjects using computed tomography, as well as clinical and physiological measures, will provide data that will enable the broad COPD syndrome to be decomposed into clinically significant subtypes. 2) Genome-wide association studies will identify genetic determinants for COPD susceptibility that will provide insight into clinically relevant COPD subtypes. 3) Distinct genetic determinants influence the development of emphysema and airway disease.** The initial phase of genome-wide association analysis included 500 COPD cases and 500 control subjects (all non-Hispanic White) genotyped with the Illumina Omni-1 chip, but plans are being developed to obtain genome-wide association analysis on the entire study cohort (using the Illumina Omni-Express chip). Unique aspects of the study include: 1) Inclusion of large numbers of African American subjects (approximately 1/3 of the cohort); 2) Obtaining chest CT scans (including inspiratory and expiratory images); and 3) Inclusion of the full range of disease severity.    * Study Weblinks: [COPDGene][2]; [NHLBI GO ESP Project][3]    * Study Types: Case-Control, Exome Sequencing    * Number of study

Individual level phenotype data and molecular data for all JHS Cohort top-level study and sub-study are available by requesting Authorized Access to the NHLBI JHS Cohort [phs000286][2] study.  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, affecting 64 million Americans and costing over 368 billion dollars annually. To elucidate causes of CVD, NIH established the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) in 1948. In 1971, 5000 adult children and spouses of original FHS participants expanded the initial population-based cohort. The FHS Offspring cohort has now been followed for a decade beyond their 6th cardiovascular examination, providing incidence and prevalence data for CVD. These data indicate that diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, cigarette smoking, obesity, sedentary life style, and family history are major risk factors for development of atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke.  With these discoveries came the unanticipated realization of considerable gender and ethnic disparities in the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, clinically overt CVD, and CVD-related mortality. White women scored lowest in each of these categories; black men scored highest. To understand and address these disparities, additional cohorts were designed with specified ethnic and racial demographics. One of these, the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), extends and expands a minority cohort living in Jackson, MS and initially identified within an earlier population-based study (The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities; ARIC). Between 2000-2004 the JHS has enrolled and conducted clinical examinations to determine the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and disease in over 5300 subjects. The JHS cohort resembles the recent FHS Offspring examination 6 cohort (JHS: 1907 men, 3395 women; mean age 55 years; FHS Offspring: 1647 men, 1866 women; mean age 59 years), however the FHS cohort contains predominantly white Americans (95%) of European ancestry while the JHS cohort contains 100% African Americans.  The role of genetic variation is documented by substantial heritability to cardiovascular disease risk factors, left ventricular hypertrophy and subclinical atherosclerosis, as well as evidence for familial aggregation of common forms of cardiovascular disease such as coronary heart disease, heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Molecular genetic studies of Mendelian disorders (and, to a much more limited degree, association studies of common variants) have led to the identification of human gene mutations that influence important CVD phenotypes. Hundreds of mutations in over 100 genes are known to produce major effects on serum cholesterol, lipoprotein and glucose levels, blood pressure via renal handling of salt and water, myocardial contractile function and ventricular morphology, and cardiac electrophysiologic properties. The phenotypes produced by single gene defects (hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiac arrhythmias) are remarkably similar to the common cardiovascular disease risk factors found broadly within the general population, raising the hypothesis that the full allelic spectrum of CVD genes may, in sum, contribute substantially to overall CVD prevalence. To provide a comprehensive assessment of the frequency and distribution of rare and common allelic variation in previously defined cardiovascular genes in general populations with defined incident cardiovascular risks and disease, we have assembled a collaborative group that includes investigators with considerable expertise in the study of CVD genes and leading investigators in the JHS.

phs000544.v1.p6::: Comprehensive Molecular Characterization of Human Colon and Rectal Cancer (CRC):::Study Description   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a comprehensive and coordinated effort to accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of genome analysis technologies. This TCGA project, _Comprehensive molecular characterization of human colon and rectal cancer_ (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012; PMID: [22810696][1]), uses tumors and matched-normal controls to characterize somatic alterations in colorectal adenocarcinoma.  This dbGaP submission contains DNA copy number and somatic mutation analysis based on a collection of 276 colorectal carcinomas. From these, low-pass whole-genome sequencing is available for a subset of 97. The project used single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays (Affymetrix) and low pass (3-5X coverage) whole genome sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 2000) to detect chromosome and sub-chromosomal copy number changes and translocations and whole exome sequencing using both the Illumina and SOLiD platforms to detect coding mutations.  Other data in the paper (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012) are not part of this submission but are available at TCGA Data Portal, Comprehensive Molecular Characterization of Human Colon and Rectal Cancer, [https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/coadread_2012/][2].

All cases were collected regardless of surgical stage or histologic grade. Cases were staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. Each frozen tumor specimen had a companion normal tissue specimen which could be blood/blood components, adjacent normal tissue taken from greater than 2 cm from the tumor, or previously extracted germline DNA from blood. Each tumor specimen weighed at least 60 mg and was typically under 200 mg. Specimens were shipped overnight from two tissue source sites (Indivumed and Christiana Care) using a cryoport that maintained an average temperature of less then -180C. Each tumor and adjacent normal tissue specimen were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium and histologic sections were obtained from top and bottom portions for review. Each H&E stained case was reviewed by a board-certified pathologist to confirm that the tumor specimen was histologically consistent with colon adenocarcinoma and the adjacent normal specimen contained no tumor cells. The sections were required to contain an average of 60% tumor cell nuclei with less than 20% necrosis for inclusion in the study per TCGA protocol requirements.  RNA and DNA were extracted from tumor specimens using a modification of the DNA/RNA AllPrep kit (Qiagen). The isolation methodology for each sample was noted in the Biospecimen XML uploaded to the DCC ([http://tcga- data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaHome2.jsp][1]). DNA was extracted from normal tissue using either the QiaAmp blood midi kit (Qiagen) or the QiaAmp tissue mini kit (Qiagen). Each specimen was quantified by measuring Abs260 with a UV spectrophotometer. DNA specimens were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis to determine the range of fragment sizes. The AmpFISTR Identifiler (Applied Biosystems) or Sequenom SNP panel procedure was utilized to verify tumor DNA and germline DNA were derived from the same patient. One g each of tumor and normal DNA was sent to Qiagen for REPLI-g whole genome amplification using a 100 g reaction scale. Only those specimens yielding a minimum of 6.9 g of tumor DNA, 2.15 g of column-purified RNA, 3.15 g TRIzol precipitated or mirVana-purified RNA, and 4.9 g of germline DNA were included in this study. Total and Column-purified RNA was analyzed via the RNA6000 assay (Agilent) for determination of an RNA Integrity Number (RIN), and only the cases with RIN >7.0 were included in this study. At the time of the data freeze, 345 colon/rectum adenocarcinoma cases were received by the BCRs and 56% passed quality control.

phs000530.v1.p1::: National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI): HIV+ Tumor Molecular Characterization Project - Lung Cancer (HTMCP - LC):::Study Description   The Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG) at the National Cancer Institute is sponsoring a series of studies as part of the Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI) to assess novel emerging sequencing technologies in cancer. The CGCI program includes comprehensive characterization of the genetic aberrations found in different pediatric and/or adult tumors. All data from these projects will be released into publicly accessible databases, with a majority of data in an open-access tier. A subset of data will be available only through a controlled-access tier due to patient privacy concerns.  CGCI is currently characterizing a number of HIV-associated tumors (including DLBCL, lung and cervical cancers). As part of CGCI, this project is a joint effort of the Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG) and the Office of HIV and AIDS Malignancy (OHAM). Its goals are to characterize HIV-associated cancers (obtained from HIV-infected patients) and compare them to the same types of cancers from patients without HIV infection.  By the end of 2003, approximately 1.2 million people living in the US were infected with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus: the precursor for AIDS or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). The global prevalence of HIV infection is approximately 40 million. People infected with HIV have an elevated risk of cancer and mortality, and cancer is a ranking cause of death among people with HIV/AIDS. It is important to understand why certain cancers, but not others, are increased in patients with HIV infection. Even though many HIV-associated cancers have a viral etiology, and immunodeficiency is believed to provide a permissive environment for viral oncogenesis, many questions remain even for those tumors that are induced by oncogenic viruses.  The Genome Sciences Center at the British Columbia Cancer Agency will perform 30X genome sequencing of 100 cases of paired tumor and germline DNA, along with transcriptome sequencing of HIV+ tumors. These platforms allow discovery of mutations both in coding and non-coding genomic regions, gene expression and genomic alterations (including translocations, insertions and deletions). Comparing tumors of cancer patients both with and without HIV-infection will provide insight into the potential function of this virus in certain cancers.  Lung cancer incidence is significantly increased among HIV-positive patients, including those on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Additionally, the tumor spectrum of Lung cancers in HIV+ patients is quite different from that seen in HIV- cases, suggesting a different biological development.    * Study Weblink: [The Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative][1]    * Study Type: Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 0  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/cgci.html  :::Cohort::: 0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000235.v4.p1.**     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000235  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   All specimens and all clinical and laboratory data gathered for this project meet the strict set of criteria established by [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)][1].

Alterations at the DNA level drive the cellular changes that are hallmarks of cancer including aberrant cell division and survival. Historically, genetic causes of cancer were studied by analysis of one or a few genes at a time. More recently however, novel high-throughput technologies have provided unprecedented capabilities to examine the cancer genome. These technologies allow systematic characterization of genetic and epigenetic alterations, allowing investigators to identify the underlying genetic changes found in cancer. The CGCI incorporates multiple approaches for genomic characterization including exome sequencing and transcriptome analysis using next generation sequencing. To encourage collaboration and leverage the collective knowledge and innovation of the entire cancer research community, all data collected will be publicly available through databases supported by the National Institutes of Health and National Cancer Institute.  The HTMCP - Lung Cancer project began in 2011 and is currently acquiring tissues for study. The first HTMCP - LC cases were sent to BCCA for sequencing in July 2012.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Marco A. Marra, PhD.

phs000489.v2.p6::: Comprehensive genomic characterization defines human glioblastoma genes and core pathways:::Study Description   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a comprehensive and coordinated effort to accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of genome analysis technologies. Glioblastoma, the most common type of adult brain tumor, was the first cancer studied by TCGA. In this article, _Comprehensive genomic characterization defines human glioblastoma genes and core pathways_ (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008; PMID: [18772890][1]), tumors and matched-normal controls are used to identify aberrations in DNA copy number, sequence, methylation, and gene expression.  This dbGaP submission contains copy number variation and somatic single- nucleotide polymorphisms in 215 primary glioblastomas as well as clinical data. Other data in the article (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008) are not included in this submission but are available at the TCGA Data Portal, Comprehensive genomic characterization defines human glioblastoma genes and core pathways, [http://tcga- data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/gbm_2008/][2].  Note: The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008, refers to a total of 206 tumor and matched-control pairs.

Samples were further selected for having matched peripheral blood as well as associated demographic, clinical and pathological data. Corresponding frozen tissues were reviewed at the Biospecimen Core Resource (BCR) to ensure a minimum of 80% tumor nuclei and a maximum of 50% necrosis. DNA and RNA extracted from qualified biospecimens were subjected to additional quality control measurements before distribution to TCGA centers for analyses.  After exclusion based on insufficient tumor content (n = 234) and suboptimal nucleic acid quality or quantity (n = 147), 206 of the 587 biospecimens screened (35%) were qualified for copy number, expression and DNA methylation analyses. Of these, 143 cases had matched normal peripheral blood DNAs and were therefore appropriate for re-sequencing. This cohort also included 21 post-treatment glioblastoma cases used for exploratory comparisons. Although it is possible that a small number of progressive secondary glioblastomas were among the remaining 185 cases of newly diagnosed glioblastomas, this cohort represents predominantly primary glioblastoma.

phs000246.v1.p1::: Fuchs&#39; Corneal Dystrophy: A Secondary Genome Wide Association Study:::Study Description   We sought to identify biological pathways contributing to Fuchs corneal dystrophy (FCD) by performing a genome wide association study (GWAS). We re- coded the ocular phenotypes for a previous GWAS on age-related macular degeneration that employed an unrelated case-control study design. The recoded cases with FCD were matched to two controls without FCD by age and gender. The genome wide genotyping results were re-analyzed using log-additive models. The SNPs most highly associated with FCD were genotyped in a second, independent group of cases with FCD and controls without FCD. Genetic variation across the TCF4 locus encoding the E-protein called E2-2 reached genome wide significance. Strong association was identified in the PTPRG locus, but did not reach genome wide significance.    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 389  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Case-Control::: 389:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000182.v2.p1.**     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000182  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   **Inclusion criteria:**    1.

phs000123.v1.p1::: Genome-Wide Association Study of Serum YKL-40 Levels:::Study Description   The chitinase-like protein, YKL-40, is involved in inflammation and tissue remodeling. Serum YKL-40 levels were elevated in patients with asthma and correlated with severity, thickening of the subepithelial basement membrane, and pulmonary function in previous studies. We conducted a genome-wide association study of serum YKL-40 levels in 632 individuals from a founder population of European descent, the Hutterites. The most significant associations were with a group of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were in perfect linkage disequilibrium (LD) in CHI3L1, the gene encoding YKL-40 (P<1.1x10-12). This association was present in children studied at birth (P=0.001) and at years 1 (P=0.009), 3 (0.0002), and 5 (P=0.002). Moreover, these SNPs were associated with asthma (P=0.047), bronchial hyperresponsiveness (P=0.0019), and measures of pulmonary function (P = 0.046 to 0.0020) in the Hutterites. A SNP in this LD group predicted asthma in the two case control populations (combined P=0.000012). We conclude that CHI3L1 is a susceptibility gene for asthma, BHR, and lung function; and circulating YKL-40 levels are a biomarker for asthma and decline in lung function.    * Study Type: Population    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 632  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>  :::Population::: 632:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000185.v1.p1.**     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000185  ::: :::Mapping250K_Nsp;Mapping250K_Sty:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Asthma ][1]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68001249[uid]  ::: :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Carole Ober.

Individual level phenotype data and molecular data for all WHI top-level study and substudies are available by requesting Authorized Access to the WHI Cohort study [phs000200][4].  **GWAS of Hormone Treatment and CVD and Metabolic Outcomes in the WHI**  This study is part of the Genomics and Randomized Trials Network (GARNET, [http://www.garnetstudy.org][5]) funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, venous thrombosis, and diabetes through large-scale genome-wide association studies of treatment response in a randomized clinical trial of hormone therapy. Genotyping was performed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Data cleaning and harmonization were performed at the GARNET Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.  Participants were selected as a nested case-control sample of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thrombosis, and incident diabetes events from the parent WHI Hormone Trial.  WHI GARNET participants are women enrolled in the WHI Hormone Therapy (HT) Trial who meet eligibility requirements for this study and eligibility for submission to dbGaP, and who provided DNA samples. Of the approximately 27,000 women who participated in the HT trial, 4,894 were genotyped on the Illumina Omni-Quad as part of WHI GARNET, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic components involved in differential responses from the HT trial. Case selection of adjudicated phenotypes of interest included coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thrombosis, and incident diabetes cases that occurred during the active phase of the Hormone Trial (HT). Controls were participants in the HT trial free of all 4 case conditions by the end of the trials. HT participants with treated diabetes at baseline were excluded from the diabetes cases and controls pool, but were still considered for cases of other 3 conditions. Matching criteria for controls were age, race/ethnicity, hysterectomy status, and enrollment date. GARNET WHI participants belong to the following self-identified ethnic groups: white (87%), black (5%), Hispanic (3%), Asian/Pacific Islander (1.8%), and American Indian (0.7%). The ethnic group is unknown for 1.9% of participants.    * Study Weblinks: [Scientific Resources Website: Women's Health Initiative][6]; [NHLBI Women's Health Initiative][7]; [GARNET][5]    * Study Type: Case-Control    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 4894  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000315.v4.p2     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [3]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=WHIAcknowledgement.pdf     [4]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000200     [5]: http://www.garnetstudy.org     [6]: http://www.whiscience.org     [7]: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/whi  :::Case-Control::: 4894:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000200.v8.p2.**  As a result of data cleaning and/or data analyses, investigators may identify genetic abnormalities that might influence the clinical care of an individual.

Controls are participants in the HT trials free of all 4 case conditions by the end of the trials. HT participants with treated diabetes at baseline were excluded from the diabetes cases and controls. In addition, cases and controls were subject to the following exclusion criteria: (1) did not have sufficient DNA volume (<2g); (2) were successfully genotyped in the SHARe project; (3) did not have IRB approval for data submission into dbGaP (IRB approved all WHI participants for dbGAP except for those who (a) refused supplemental consent, (b) signed supplemental consent but later declined genetic testing, and (c) declined genetic testing without ever signing to Supplemental Consent). Matching criteria are Age (5 years), Race/Ethnicity (0), Hysterectomy status (0), Enrollment date (1.5 years), and Length of follow-up (48 months). Controls were also prioritized on the basis of availability of plasma CVD biomarker availability (Glucose, HDL-C, LDL-C, Total cholesterol, Insulin, Triglycerides, CRP, Fibrinogen).

phs000531.v1.p1::: National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI): Medulloblastoma:::Study Description   The Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG) at the National Cancer Institute is sponsoring a series of studies as part of the Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI) to assess novel emerging sequencing technologies in cancer. The CGCI program includes comprehensive characterization of the genetic aberrations found in different pediatric and/or adult tumors, including medulloblastoma.  Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor found in children. In order to identify the genetic alterations in MB, copy number alterations were sought using high-density microarrays and sequenced all known protein-coding genes and miRNA genes using Sanger sequencing in a set of 22 pediatric MB samples and one matched normal blood sample. All tumor samples were obtained at the time of original surgery (pre-treatment) except for one sample, which was obtained at the time of MB recurrence.  Protein-encoding transcripts to be targeted for sequencing were derived from transcripts present in the Ensembl (file date 8/27/2008), RefSeq (file date 1/18/2009), and CCDS (file date 2/02/2009) databases and downloaded from the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics site. The protein encoding transcripts were supplemented with microRNA transcripts downloaded from the Sanger miRBase Sequence Database (Release 13.0) in order to yield a combined set of transcripts representing 24,893 genes (24,178 protein encoding and 715 microRNA). The regions of interest (ROIs) targeted for sequencing comprised the entire transcribed portion of the microRNA exons and the protein encoding portion plus 4 bases of flanking sequence for the protein encoding exons. Illumina Infinium II Whole Genome Genotyping Assay employing the BeadChip platform was used to analyze the same set of tumor samples at 1,199,187 (1M- Duo) SNP loci in order to detect copy number alterations in the same set of tumors.    * Study Weblink: [The Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative][1]    * Study Type: Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 23  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/cgci.html  :::Cohort::: 23:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000235.v4.p1.**     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000235  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   The Discovery Screen consisted of 22 tumor samples (17 primary tumors, 4 xenografts, and 1 cell line), with the Prevalence Screen including another 66 primary tumors.

All samples had been given a diagnosis of MB (WHO grade IV) by institutional report. All samples with available hemotoxylin and eosin- stained (H+E) slides or available tissue blocks from which new H+E slides could be produced were subjected to central review by a pediatric neuropathologist (PB) (scanned images of H+E slides of samples are available at [http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Data_Access)][2]. For each slide the percentage of tumor cells present was estimated, and the MBs were subclassified as large cell/anaplastic (LCA), nodular/desmoplastic (ND), or classic, non-nodular (C) when possible. All tumor samples were obtained at the time of the original surgery except one, which was obtained at the time of MB recurrence.

Alterations at the DNA level drive the cellular changes that are hallmarks of cancer including aberrant cell division and survival. Historically, genetic causes of cancer were studied by analysis of one or a few genes at a time. More recently however, novel high-throughput technologies have provided unprecedented capabilities to examine the cancer genome. These technologies allow systematic characterization of genetic and epigenetic alterations, allowing investigators to identify the underlying genetic changes found in cancer. The CGCI incorporates multiple approaches for genomic characterization including exome sequencing and transcriptome analysis using next generation sequencing. To encourage collaboration and leverage the collective knowledge and innovation of the entire cancer research community, all data collected will be publicly available through databases supported by the National Institutes of Health and National Cancer Institute.

Individual level phenotype data and molecular data for all MESA top-level study and substudies are available by requesting Authorized Access to the MESA Cohort study [phs000209][4].  **MESA**  > The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a study of the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease (disease detected non- invasively before it has produced clinical signs and symptoms) and the risk factors that predict progression to clinically overt cardiovascular disease or progression of the subclinical disease. MESA researchers study a diverse, population-based sample of 6,814 asymptomatic men and women aged 45-84. Thirty-eight percent of the recruited participants are white, 28 percent African-American, 22 percent Hispanic, and 12 percent Asian, predominantly of Chinese descent.<p>  Participants were recruited from six field centers across the United States: Wake Forest University, Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and University of California - Los Angeles. Each participant received an extensive physical exam to determine coronary calcification, ventricular mass and function, flow-mediated endothelial vasodilation, carotid intimal-medial wall thickness and presence of echogenic lucencies in the carotid artery, lower extremity vascular insufficiency, arterial wave forms, electrocardiographic (ECG) measures, standard coronary risk factors, sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors, and psychosocial factors. Selected repetition of subclinical disease measures and risk factors at follow-up visits allows study of the progression of disease. Blood samples have been assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for case-control studies. DNA has been extracted and lymphocytes cryopreserved (for possible immortalization) for study of candidate genes and possibly, genome-wide scanning, expression, and other genetic techniques. Participants are being followed for identification and characterization of cardiovascular disease events, including acute myocardial infarction and other forms of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and congestive heart failure; for cardiovascular disease interventions; and for mortality.  In addition to the six Field Centers, MESA involves a Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, and Central Reading Centers for Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Ultrasound, and Electrocardiography (ECG). Protocol development, staff training, and pilot testing were performed in the first 18 months of the study. The first examination took place over two years, from July 2000 - July 2002. It was followed by four examination periods that were 17-20 months in length. Participants have been contacted every 9 to 12 months throughout the study to assess clinical morbidity and mortality.  **NHLBI Candidate-gene Association Resource.** The NHLBI initiated the Candidate gene Association Resource (CARe) to create a shared genotype/phenotype resource for analyses of the association of genotypes with phenotypes relevant to the mission of the NHLBI. The resource comprises nine cohort studies funded by the NHLBI including: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Cleveland Family Study (CFS), Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Jackson Heart Study (JHS), Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). A database of genotype and phenotype data was created that includes records for approximately 41,000 study participants with approximately 50,000 SNPs from more than 2,000 selected candidate genes. In addition, a genome wide association study using a 1,000K SNP Chip was conducted on approximately 8,900 African American participants drawn from five CARe cohorts: ARIC, CARDIA, CFS, JHS, and MESA. Data from individual cohorts is available to approved investigators through dbGaP.  **Some relevant CARe publications**  > CARe Study: PMID <a href="http:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20400780" target="_blank">20400780  > CVD Chip Design: PMID <a href="http:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974833" target="_blank">18974833    * Study Weblink: [MESA][5]    * Study Type: Longitudinal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 6351  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000283.v4.p2     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [3]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=MESAAcknowledgement.pdf     [4]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000209     [5]: http://www.mesa-nhlbi.org/  :::Longitudinal::: 6351:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000209.v10.p2.**     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000209  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   Eligible MESA participants were defined as persons living within the defined geographic boundaries for each Field Center between the ages of 45 and 84 at enumeration, who are African-American, Chinese-American, Caucasian, or Hispanic, and who do not meet any of the exclusion criteria (see below). Target race/ethnic groups for each field center were chosen to maximize efficiency to detect race/ethnic differences and to allow the separation of the effect of race/ethnicity from that of study site.  MESA's primary hypotheses are concerned with the determinants and natural history of subclinical cardiovascular disease. Therefore, participants with known clinical disease were not recruited. Most other exclusion criteria related to the long-term nature of the study or to incompatibility with certain components of the MESA exam. Eligibility (or ineligibility) status was determined from self-reported information and no attempt was made to validate the participant's response. MESA's exclusion criteria are below:    * Age younger than 45 or older than 84 years    * Physician-diagnosed heart attack    * Physician-diagnosed angina or taking nitroglycerin    * Physician-diagnosed stroke or TIA    * Physician-diagnosed heart failure    * Current atrial fibrillation    * Having undergone procedures related to cardiovascular disease (CABG, angioplasty, valve replacement, pacemaker or defibrillator implantation, any surgery on the heart or arteries)    * Active treatment for cancer    * Pregnancy    * Any serious medical condition which would prevent long-term participation    * Weight >300 pounds    * Cognitive inability as judged by the interviewer    * Living in a nursing home or on the waiting list for a nursing home    * Plans to leave the community within five years    * Language barrier (speaks other than English, Spanish, Cantonese or Mandarin)    * Chest CT scan in the past year  :::AFFY_6.0;CVDSNP55v1_A:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Cardiovascular Diseases ][1]    * [ Atherosclerosis ][2]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68002318[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68050197[uid]  ::: :::Study Attribution     * ** MESA Principal Investigators **      * Richard Kronmal, PhD.

phs000227.v1.p2::: Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology - Women&#39;s Health Initiative Clinical Trial and Observational Study:::Study Description   ** Important Links and Information **    * [Data Use Certification Agreement][1]    * [Apply for Authorized Access ][2]    * [Acknowledgement Statements][3]  This substudy phs000227 PAGE WHI contains genotypes generated using BeadXpress and Metabochip, produced as part of NHGRI's PAGE project. Summary level phenotypes for the WHI Cohort study participants can be viewed at the top- level study page [phs000200][4] WHI Cohort. Individual level phenotype data and molecular data for all WHI top-level study and substudies are available by requesting Authorized Access to the WHI Cohort study [phs000200][4].  **WHI**  > The Women&#39;s Health Initiative (WHI) is a long-term national health study that has focused on strategies for preventing heart disease, breast and colorectal cancer and osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women. These chronic diseases are the major causes of death, disability and frailty in older women of all races and socioeconomic backgrounds.<p>  This cohort is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), involves 161,808 women aged 50-79, and is one of the most definitive, far-reaching clinical trials of post- menopausal women's health ever undertaken in the U.S. Women were recruited between 1993 to 1998 at 40 centers across the US and follow up is planned to continue until at least 2015. The WHI Clinical Trial and Observational Study focused on many of the inequities in women's health research and will continue to provide practical information to women and their physicians about hormone therapy, dietary patterns, calcium/vitamin D supplementation, and their effects on the prevention of heart disease, cancer and osteoporotic fractures.  The WHI has two major parts: a randomized Clinical Trial and an Observational Study. The randomized controlled Clinical Trial (CT) enrolled 68,132 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50-79 into trials testing three prevention strategies. If eligible, women could choose to enroll in one, two, or all three of the trial components. The components are:    * **Hormone Therapy Trials (HT)**: This component examined the effects of combined hormones or estrogen alone on the prevention of coronary heart disease and osteoporotic fractures, and associated risk for breast cancer. Women participating in this component took hormone pills or a placebo (inactive pill) until the Estrogen plus Progestin and Estrogen Alone trials were stopped early in July 2002 and March 2004, respectively. All HT participants continued to be followed without intervention until close-out.    * **Dietary Modification Trial (DM)**: The Dietary Modification component evaluated the effect of a low-fat and high fruit, vegetable and grain diet on the prevention of breast and colorectal cancers and coronary heart disease. Study participants followed either their usual eating pattern or a low-fat dietary pattern.    * **Calcium/Vitamin D Trial (CaD)**: This component began 1 to 2 years after a woman joined one or both of the other clinical trial components. It evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. Women in this component took calcium and vitamin D pills or a placebo.  The **Observational Study (OS)** is examining the relationship between lifestyle, health and risk factors and specific disease outcomes. This component involves tracking the medical history and health habits of 93,676 women.  To fully examine the profile of gene and environment interaction, or "epidemiologic architecture," we will comprehensively evaluate such putative genuine variants in the Women's Health Initiative This large study population not only enables us to examine the population incidence for racial and ethnic subgroups and associated risks of rigorously defined, incident diseases (specific aim 1) but allows us to investigate associated risks given in-depth information on various environmental exposures and disease risk factors as well as three randomized interventions (hormone therapy; low-fat dietary modification; calcium + vitamin D supplements) (specific aim 2). The prospective and longitudinal collection of biospecimens, intermediate outcomes, and phenotypic characteristics, such as bone mineral density, hormone concentrations, breast density, or inflammation will further permit us to link genetic variants to relevant intermediate phenotypes, which will potentially provide important clues to the biological basis of the genuine associations (specific aim 3). For a variety of outcomes we will genotype within this 4-year project 72,000 participants for disease-specific putative genuine variants. Information generated from this study will be critical to determine the health impact of any given undisputable variant. Findings may also provide valuable insights into disease pathways and mechanisms, and targets for disease screening, prevention, and treatment.    * Study Weblinks: [WHI][5]; [NHLBI WHI][6]; [Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE)][7]    * Study Type: Case-Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 36186  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000227.v1.p2     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [3]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=WHIAcknowledgement.pdf     [4]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000200     [5]: http://www.whi.org     [6]: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/whi     [7]: http://www.pagestudy.org  :::Case-Cohort::: 36186:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000200.v8.p2.**     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000200  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   **Inclusion criteria:** Postmenopausal women, aged 50 to 79, who were able and willing to provide written informed consent and who expected to reside in the study recruitment area for at least 3 years following enrollment were eligible.  **Exclusion criteria:** Study subjects were excluded from the WHI CT and OS if they had medical conditions predictive of a survival time of less than 3 years; if they were known to have conditions that might affect study participation and adherence (alcoholism, drug dependency, mental illness, dementia); or if they were active participants in another randomized controlled clinical trial.

phs000441.v2.p6::: Integrated Genomic Analyses of Ovarian Carcinoma (OV):::Study Description   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a comprehensive and coordinated effort to accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of genome analysis technologies. The article, _Integrated Genomic Analyses of Ovarian Carcinoma_ (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011; PMID: [21720365][1]), uses tumors and matched-normal controls to identify molecular aberrations associated with ovarian cancer.  This dbGaP submission contains data on copy number variation in 488 high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinomas, DNA sequence variation in exons from 316 of these cases, and relevant disease information.  Other data in the paper (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011) are not part of this submission but are available at TCGA Data Portal, Integrated Genomic Analyses of Ovarian Carcinoma, [ http://tcga- data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/ov_2011/][2]. They include the analysis of messenger RNA expression, microRNA expression, and promoter methylation.  Note: The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011, originally reported data for 489 tumors and matched controls. However, the genomic data for tumor sample TCGA-61-1721-01A appeared normal and has been omitted from this submission. In addition, six of the 488 subjects lack copy number data for their blood-derived normal controls: TCGA-13-0730, TCGA-09-0366, TCGA-13-0725, TCGA-13-0760, TCGA-23-1028, TCGA-13-0723.    * Study Weblink: [Integrated Genomic Analyses of Ovarian Carcinoma][2]    * Study Type: Tumor vs. Matched-Normal    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 595  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21720365     [2]: http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/ov_2011/  :::Tumor vs. Matched-Normal::: 595:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000178.v7.p6.**     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000178  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   This study reports the analysis of 488 clinically annotated stage-II-IV HGS- OvCa samples and corresponding normal DNA. Patients reflected the age at diagnosis, stage, tumor grade and surgical outcome of individuals typically diagnosed with HGS-OvCa. Clinical data were current as of 25 August 2010. HGS- OvCa specimens were surgically resected before systemic treatment, but all patients received a platinum agent and 94% received a taxane. The median progression-free survival and overall survival of the cohort are similar to those in previously published trials. Twenty-five percent of the patients remained free from disease and 45% were alive at the time of last follow-up, whereas 31% experienced disease progression within six months of completing platinum-based therapy. The median follow-up time was 30 months (range, 0-179 months). Samples for TCGA analysis were selected to have >70% tumor cell nuclei and <20% necrosis.  Biospecimens were collected from newly diagnosed patients with ovarian serous adenocarcinoma who were undergoing surgical resection and had received no prior treatment for their disease, including chemotherapy or radiotherapy. All cases had to be of serous histology, but were collected regardless of surgical stage or histologic grade. Cases were staged according to the 1988 FIGO staging system. Each frozen tumor specimen had to have a companion normal tissue specimen, which could be adjacent normal tissue, peripheral lymphocytes, or previously extracted germline DNA. Each tumor specimen was approximately 1 cm3 in size and weighed between 100mg and 200mg, in general. Each specimen was embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium and histologic sections were obtained from top and bottom portions for review. Each case was reviewed by a board-certified pathologist to confirm that the frozen section was histologically consistent with ovarian serous adenocarcinoma. The top and bottom sections had to contain an average of 70% tumor cell nuclei with less than 20% necrosis. Specimens were shipped overnight from one of 15 tissue source sites using a cryoport that maintained an average temperature of less then -180C.

Summary level phenotypes for the Cardiovascular Health Study Cohort study participants can be viewed at the top-level study page phs000287 Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) Cohort. Individual level phenotype data and molecular data for the Cardiovascular Health Study top-level study and substudies are available by requesting Authorized Access to the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) Cohort study [phs000287][4]. **  **Objectives:**  The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is a study of risk factors for development and progression of CHD and stroke in people aged 65 years and older. The objectives of the Cardiovascular Health Study are to: 1) quantify associations of conventional and hypothesized risk factors with CHD and stroke; 2) assess the associations of non-invasive measures of subclinical disease with the incidence of CHD and stroke; 3) quantify the associations of risk factors with subclinical disease; 4) characterize the natural history of CHD and stroke, and identify factors associated with clinical course; and 5) describe the prevalence and distributions of risk factors, non-invasive measures of subclinical disease, and clinical CHD and stroke.  **Background:**  The study originated in 1988 from the recommendations of an NHLBI workshop on the management of CHD in the elderly. This is the most extensive study undertaken by the NHLBI to study CVD exclusively in an elderly population. Initially funded for six years, it was renewed for a second six year period in 1994 and recently was renewed for continued morbidity and mortality follow-up.  **Subjects:**  The 5,888 study participants were recruited from four U.S. communities and have undergone extensive clinic examinations for evaluation of markers of subclinical cardiovascular disease. The original cohort totaled 5,201 participants. A new cohort was recruited in 1992. The 687 participants in the new cohort are predominately African-American and were recruited at three of the four field centers.  **Design:**  The 2,962 women and 2,239 men were examined yearly from 1989 through 1999. The added minority cohort of 256 men and 431 women was examined from 1992 to 1999. Examination components have included medical history questionnaires, measurement of ankle-brachial index, abdominal and carotid ultrasound studies, echocardiograms, ambulatory electrocardiograms, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, spirometry and retinal photographs over the past decade. The most extensive evaluations were at study entry (baseline) and again in 1992-1993 to assess change in subclinical disease measures. CHS has undertaken extensive follow-up for ascertainment of cardiovascular events including incident claudication, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke and death.    * Study Weblinks: [Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE)][5]; [CHS][6]    * Study Types: Longitudinal, Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 0  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000301.v1.p1     [2]: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login     [3]: ./GetPdf.cgi?document_name=CHSAcknowledgement.pdf     [4]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000287     [5]: http://www.pagestudy.org     [6]: http://www.chs-nhlbi.org/default.htm  :::Longitudinal, Cohort::: 0:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000287.v2.p1.**     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000287  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   Participants aged 65 and older were recruited from random samples of Medicare eligibility lists in four communities: Sacramento County, California; Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and from age-eligible participants in the same household.

phs000307.v3.p7::: Framingham Heart Study Allelic Spectrum Project:::Study Description   This substudy includes the generation of deep coverage targeted re-sequencing and variant identification for 216 genes in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) sample collection, produced as part of NHLBI's Medical Resequencing projects. Summary level phenotypes for the Framingham Cohort study participants can be viewed at the top-level study page [phs000007][1] Framingham Cohort. Individual level phenotype data and molecular data for all Framingham top- level study and substudies are available by requesting Authorized Access to the Framingham Cohort study [phs000007][1].  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, affecting 64 million Americans and costing over 368 billion dollars annually. To elucidate causes of CVD, NIH established the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) in 1948. In 1971, 5000 adult children and spouses of original FHS participants expanded the initial population-based cohort. The FHS Offspring cohort has now been followed for a decade beyond their 6th cardiovascular examination, providing incidence and prevalence data for CVD. These data indicate that diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, cigarette smoking, obesity, sedentary life style, and family history are major risk factors for development of atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke.  The role of genetic variation is documented by substantial heritability to cardiovascular disease risk factors, left ventricular hypertrophy and subclinical atherosclerosis, as well as evidence for familial aggregation of common forms of cardiovascular disease such as coronary heart disease, heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Molecular genetic studies of Mendelian disorders (and, to a much more limited degree, association studies of common variants) have led to the identification of human gene mutations that influence important CVD phenotypes. Hundreds of mutations in over 100 genes are known to produce major effects on serum cholesterol, lipoprotein and glucose levels, blood pressure via renal handling of salt and water, myocardial contractile function and ventricular morphology, and cardiac electrophysiologic properties. The phenotypes produced by single gene defects (hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiac arrhythmias) are remarkably similar to the common cardiovascular disease risk factors found broadly within the general population, raising the hypothesis that the full allelic spectrum of CVD genes may, in sum, contribute substantially to overall CVD prevalence.  To provide a comprehensive assessment of the frequency and distribution of rare and common allelic variation in previously defined cardiovascular genes in general populations with defined incident cardiovascular risks and disease, we have assembled a collaborative group that includes investigators with considerable expertise in the study of CVD genes and leading investigators in the FHS.    * Study Type: Cohort    * Number of study subjects that have individual level data available through Authorized Access: 1637  > <div id="participantVennDiagram"> <div>     [1]: ./study.cgi?study_id=phs000007  :::Cohort::: 1637:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   **Note: Access to publicly available data is available on the [public ftp site][1] for study [phs000007.v18.p7.**     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000007  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   DNA samples from 1800 randomly selected unrelated FHS Offspring subjects who participated in examination 6 were used for the sequencing analysis.  :::Genome Analyzer II:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Cardiovascular Diseases ][1]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68002318[uid]  ::: :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Eric Lander.

phs000400.v1.p1::: National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) GO-ESP: Heart Cohorts Component of the Exome Sequencing Project (CHS):::  The NHLBI "Grand Opportunity" Exome Sequencing Project (GO-ESP), a signature project of the NHLBI Recovery Act investment, was designed to identify genetic variants in coding regions (exons) of the human genome (the "exome") that are associated with heart, lung and blood diseases. These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied. These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease, contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention and treatments to specific populations. This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects. GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers - BroadGO and SeattleGO.  HeartGO is a consortium of six well-phenotyped NHLBI cohorts: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, the Cardiovascular Health Study, the Framingham Heart Study, the Jackson Heart Study, and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Together, these cohorts have provided DNA and phenotype datasets from a diverse cohort of individuals of African-American, Caucasian, Asian, and Hispanic ancestry to be made available for use by qualified investigators in dbGaP. HeartGO investigators will conduct genotype-phenotype analyses for phenotypes related not only to heart disease but with other variables that will be contributed to dbGaP. The HeartGO dataset provides investigators with genotype-phenotype analytic opportunities for traits not only related to heart disease but also associated with ancillary variables that will be contributed to dbGaP, including disease endpoints, risk factors, biomarkers, and subclinical disease measures.  The phenotypes planned for investigation as part of the GO-ESP HeartGO project include early-onset myocardial infarction (EOMI), low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, body mass index/type 2 diabetes (BMI/T2D), blood pressure and ischemic stroke. Results of the proposed analyses as well as relevant replication/follow-up analyses will be reported in peer-reviewed journals.  This study phs000400 contains the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) subset of GO-ESP/Heart-GO. Additional GO-ESP data is also available via dbGaP.    * Study Weblink: [NHLBI GO-ESP:::Case-Cohort, Case-Control, Cohort, Affected Sib Pairs, Exome Sequencing::: 25:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   [ Connect to public download site ][1]     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000400  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   The following are the inclusion/exclusion criteria across the HeartGO consortia phenotype groups; each HeartGO cohort was represented in one or more of these phenotype groups.  _Early-Onset MI (EOMI):_  > Within each of two ethnic groups (whites and blacks), selection of 200 cases with early-onset myocardial infarction (MI) and 200 participants with absence of MI despite extreme Framingham Risk Score (FRS).<br> _Inclusion_ of individuals with consent and DNA available; for cases, the participant data includes study adjudication of reported MI and onset prior to age 45y (men) or 55y (women); for comparison (non-MI) participants, there must be data to calculate the Framingham Risk Score (FRS; age, sex, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, blood pressure medications), with age greater than 50y (men) or 60y (women).  > <i>Exclusion<i> of participants with prevalent or incident CVD; cases with self-reported MI but without adjudication of clinical data.  > <p>  _LDL Cholesterol (LDL):_  > Within each of two ethnic groups (whites and blacks), selection of 100 participants with extremely low LDL and 100 participants with extremely high LDL, after adjustment for age, sex, lipid medication status.<br> _Inclusion_ requires consent and available DNA, and presence of the following variables: race, sex, LDL measurement (baseline and any additional), age at LDL measurement, lipid-lowering medication status.  > <i>Exclusion<i>: not being sequenced for other phenotypes.  > <p>  _Blood Pressure (BP):_  > Within each of two ethnic groups (whites and blacks), selection of 200 participants with extremely low residual systolic and diastolic blood pressure and 200 participants with extremely high residual systolic and diastolic blood pressure, after adjustment for age, sex, medication status and BMI.<br> _Inclusion_ requires consent and available DNA, and presence of the following variables: race, sex, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), age, hypertension medication status and BMI.  > <i>Exclusion<i> of participants (or data) with age > 69 yr, prevalent MI, heart failure or BMI > 4SD at any exam but only for that exam (for those participants with multiple measurements); for selection of extreme low BP individuals, exclude those individuals who are on antihypertensive treatment or who are unknown to be on antihypertensive treatment.  > <p>  _Ischemic Stroke (STROKE):_  > Within each of two ethnic groups (whites and blacks), selection of 250 participants with early onset (less than 65y) or positive family history of ischemic stroke.

phs000090.v1.p1::: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study:::Study Description   The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), is a prospective epidemiologic study conducted in four U.S. communities. The four communities are Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; the northwest suburbs of Minneapolis, MN; and Washington County, MD. ARIC is designed to investigate the etiology and natural history of atherosclerosis, the etiology of clinical atherosclerotic diseases, and variation in cardiovascular risk factors, medical care and disease by race, gender, location, and date.  ARIC includes two parts: the Cohort Component and the Community Surveillance Component. The Cohort Component began in 1987, and each ARIC field center randomly selected and recruited a cohort sample of approximately 4,000 individuals aged 45-64 from a defined population in their community. A total of 15,792 participants received an extensive examination, including medical, social, and demographic data. These participants were reexamined every three years with the first screen (baseline) occurring in 1987-89, the second in 1990-92, the third in 1993-95, and the fourth and last exam was in 1996-98. Follow-up occurs yearly by telephone to maintain contact with participants and to assess health status of the cohort.  In the Community Surveillance Component, currently ongoing, these four communities are investigated to determine the community-wide occurrence of hospitalized myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease deaths in men and women aged 35-84 years. Hospitalized stroke is investigated in cohort participants only. Starting in 2006, the study conducts community surveillance of inpatient (ages 55 years and older) and outpatient heart failure (ages 65 years and older) for heart failure events beginning in 2005.  ARIC is currently funded through January 31, 2012.  This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, [http://www.genevastudy.org][1]) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease through large-scale genome-wide association studies of well- characterized cohorts of adults in four defined populations. Genotyping was performed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, a GENEVA genotyping center. Data cleaning and harmonization were done at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.    :::Case-Cohort::: 12771:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   [ Connect to public download site ][1]  In the course of routine data cleaning and data analyses, investigators may incidentally identify genetic abnormalities that might influence the clinical care of an individual.

phs000401.v1.p1::: National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) GO-ESP: Heart Cohorts Component of the Exome Sequencing Project (FHS):::Study Description   The NHLBI "Grand Opportunity" Exome Sequencing Project (GO-ESP), a signature project of the NHLBI Recovery Act investment, was designed to identify genetic variants in coding regions (exons) of the human genome (the "exome") that are associated with heart, lung and blood diseases. These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied. These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease, contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention and treatments to specific populations. This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects. GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers - BroadGO and SeattleGO.  HeartGO is a consortium of six well-phenotyped NHLBI cohorts: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, the Cardiovascular Health Study, the Framingham Heart Study, the Jackson Heart Study, and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Together, these cohorts have provided DNA and phenotype datasets from a diverse cohort of individuals of African-American, Caucasian, Asian, and Hispanic ancestry to be made available for use by qualified investigators in dbGaP. HeartGO investigators will conduct genotype-phenotype analyses for phenotypes related not only to heart disease but with other variables that will be contributed to dbGaP. The HeartGO dataset provides investigators with genotype-phenotype analytic opportunities for traits not only related to heart disease but also associated with ancillary variables that will be contributed to dbGaP, including disease endpoints, risk factors, biomarkers, and subclinical disease measures.  The phenotypes planned for investigation as part of the GO-ESP HeartGO project include early-onset myocardial infarction (EOMI), low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, body mass index/type 2 diabetes (BMI/T2D), blood pressure and ischemic stroke. Results of the proposed analyses as well as relevant replication/follow-up analyses will be reported in peer-reviewed journals.  This study phs000401 contains the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) subset of GO- ESP/Heart-GO.

Since that time the FHS has added an Offspring Cohort in 1971, an Omni Cohort in 1994, a Third Generation Cohort in 2002, a New Offspring Spouse Cohort in 2003, and a Second Generation Omni Cohort in 2003. Over the years, careful monitoring of the FHS population has led to the identification of major CVD risk factors, as well as valuable information on the effects of these factors such as blood pressure, blood triglyceride and cholesterol levels, age, gender, and psychosocial issues. Risk factors for other physiological conditions such as dementia have been and continue to be investigated. In addition, the relationships between physical traits and genetic patterns are being studied.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Stephen Rich, PhD.

phs000223.v1.p1::: Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE): Causal Variants Across the Life Course (CALiCo): Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC):::  **CALiCo ARIC**  > The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC), sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), is a prospective epidemiologic study conducted in four U.S. communities. ARIC is designed to investigate the etiology and natural history of atherosclerosis, the etiology of clinical atherosclerotic diseases, and variation in cardiovascular risk factors, medical care and disease by race, gender, location, and date. ARIC includes a Cohort Component and a Community Surveillance Component. Cohort enrollment began in 1987. Each ARIC field center randomly selected and recruited a sample of approximately 4,000 individuals aged 45-64 from a defined population in their community. A total of 15,792 participants received an extensive examination, including medical, social, and demographic data. These participants were reexamined every three years with the first screen (baseline) occurring in 1987-89, the second in 1990-92, the third in 1993-95, and the fourth and last exam wastook place in 1996-98. Follow-up occurs yearly byA fifth cohort examination is underway (2011-2013). Yearly telephone tointerviews maintain contact with participants and to assess health status of the cohort.<p>  In the Community Surveillance Component, currently ongoing, these four communities are investigated to determine the community-wide occurrence of hospitalized myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease deaths in men and women aged 35-84 years. Hospitalized stroke is investigated in cohort participants only. The study conducts community surveillance of inpatient heart failure (ages 55 years and older) and cohort surveillance outpatient heart failure events beginning in 2005.    * Study Weblinks: [Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE):::Longitudinal::: 3743:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   [ Connect to public download site ][1]     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000223  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   Subjects must reside in the ARIC study area, their age of enrollment must be between 45-64 years, and have no plan to move from the community in the next 6 months.  :::Cardio-Metabo_Chip_11395247_A;TaqMan OpenArrays: CALiCo ABD TaqMan Y1;TaqMan OpenArrays: CALiCo ABD TaqMan Y2;TaqMan OpenArrays: CALiCo AOD TaqMan Y1;TaqMan OpenArrays: CALiCo AOD TaqMan Y2;TaqMan OpenArrays: CALiCo DME TaqMan Y1;TaqMan OpenArrays: CALiCo DME TaqMan Y2;TaqMan OpenArrays: CALiCo Sequenom Y2:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ][1]    * [ Obesity ][2]    * [ Cholesterol, HDL ][3]    * [ Cholesterol, LDL ][4]    * [ Coronary Disease ][5]    * [ Triglycerides ][6]    * [ Myocardial Infarction ][7]    * [ C-Reactive Protein ][8]    * [ Gout ][9]    * [ Uric Acid ][10]    * [ Kidney ][11]    * [ Stroke ][12]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68003924[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68009765[uid]     [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68008076[uid]     [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68008078[uid]     [5]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68003327[uid]     [6]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68014280[uid]     [7]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68009203[uid]     [8]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68002097[uid]     [9]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68006073[uid]     [10]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&ter m=68014527[uid]     [11]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&ter m=68007668[uid]     [12]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&ter m=68020521[uid]  :::Study History   Baseline recruitment occurred from 1987-89, with follow-up visits every three years until 1998.

phs000226.v2.p1::: STAMPEED: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) GWAS to identify genetic variants associated with aging and CVD risk factors and events:::  The primary aim of the study is to conduct a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and heart failure (HF) among participants enrolled in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) who were free of clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline. The secondary aim is to conduct genome-wide association study of other phenotypes in CHS. The study is an ancillary study to CHS. CHS is a population-based cohort study of risk factors for heart disease and stroke among older adults recruited at 4 US sites in 1989-1990. Subjects underwent an extensive baseline examination, and annual follow-up examinations through 1988-1999.    * Study Weblinks: [CHS:::Longitudinal::: 3995:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   [ Connect to public download site ][1]     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000226  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   The four Field Centers of the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) are located in Forsyth County, NC; Sacramento County, CA; Washington County, MD; and Pittsburgh, PA. In June 1990, four Field Centers completed the recruitment of 5201 participants. In June 1993, an additional 687 African Americans were recruited using similar methods. Each community sample was obtained from random samples of the Medicare eligibility lists of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). Eligible to participate were persons living in the household of each sampled individual who were: 1) 65 yrs or older; 2) non- institutionalized; 3) expected to remain in the area for 3 yrs; and 4) able to give informed consent. Excluded were those wheelchair-bound, receiving hospice care or cancer treatment. The minority cohort was recruited using similar methods. Participants were eligible whether or not they had clinically apparent cardiovascular disease.  For the genome-wide association study, an ancillary study of CHS, participants who had clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline were excluded. Clinical cardiovascular disease was defined as any of the following conditions: coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, valvular heart disease, stroke, and transient ischemic attack. Participants were also excluded if they did have available DNA or did not provide written informed consent for genetic studies. Of the 4056 participants eligible for whole genome scans, 3869 had DNA and their scans produced data that passed quality control standards.  :::HumanCNV370v1:::Diseases Related to Study (MESH terms)     * [ Cardiovascular Diseases ][1]    * [ Cerebrovascular Disorders ][2]    * [ Stroke ][3]    * [ Aging ][4]     [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68002318[uid]     [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68002561[uid]     [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68020521[uid]     [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?&CMD=search&DB=mesh&term =68000375[uid]  :::Study History   CHS is an NHLBI contract-funded cohort study designed to evaluate risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke in older adults.

The coordinating center, located at Jackson State University, collects and analyzes data. The exam center at the University of Mississippi is responsible for recruiting participants and conducting examinations. The JHS baseline examination occurred in 2004 and obtained extensive interviews and medical history data as well as anthropometric, blood pressure, ECG, and pulmonary function data. Blood collections were analyzed for hematologic, lipids, iron metabolism and endocrine data. The JHS is uniquely positioned to answer key questions regarding the excess burden of CVD among African Americans and to address the critical shortage of minority examination The Second Exam occurred in 2005-2008 with repeat and novel measures of CVD risk. The third examination is ongoing and lasting through 2012. In addition to the JHS cohort, a Family Study component has been initiated to further explore the genetic contributions to disease risk.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Stephen Rich, PhD.

phs000398.v1.p1::: National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) GO-ESP: Heart Cohorts Component of the Exome Sequencing Project (ARIC):::Study Description   The NHLBI "Grand Opportunity" Exome Sequencing Project (GO-ESP), a signature project of the NHLBI Recovery Act investment, was designed to identify genetic variants in coding regions (exons) of the human genome (the "exome") that are associated with heart, lung and blood diseases. These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied. These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease, contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention and treatments to specific populations. This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects. GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers - BroadGO and SeattleGO.  HeartGO is a consortium of six well-phenotyped NHLBI cohorts: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, the Cardiovascular Health Study, the Framingham Heart Study, the Jackson Heart Study, and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Together, these cohorts have provided DNA and phenotype datasets from a diverse cohort of individuals of African-American, Caucasian, Asian, and Hispanic ancestry to be made available for use by qualified investigators in dbGaP. HeartGO investigators will conduct genotype-phenotype analyses for phenotypes related not only to heart disease but with other variables that will be contributed to dbGaP. The HeartGO dataset provides investigators with genotype-phenotype analytic opportunities for traits not only related to heart disease but also associated with ancillary variables that will be contributed to dbGaP, including disease endpoints, risk factors, biomarkers, and subclinical disease measures.  The phenotypes planned for investigation as part of the GO-ESP HeartGO project include early-onset myocardial infarction (EOMI), low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, body mass index/type 2 diabetes (BMI/T2D), blood pressure and ischemic stroke. Results of the proposed analyses as well as relevant replication/follow-up analyses will be reported in peer-reviewed journals.  This study phs000398 contains the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) subset of GO-ESP/Heart-GO. Additional GO-ESP data is also available via dbGaP.    :::Case-Cohort, Case-Control, Cohort, Affected Sib Pairs, Exome Sequencing::: 595:::Publicly Available Data (Public ftp)   [ Connect to public download site ][1]     [1]: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs000398  :::Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   The following are the inclusion/exclusion criteria across the HeartGO consortia phenotype groups; each HeartGO cohort was represented in one or more of these phenotype groups.  _Early-Onset MI (EOMI):_  > Within each of two ethnic groups (whites and blacks), selection of 200 cases with early-onset myocardial infarction (MI) and 200 participants with absence of MI despite extreme Framingham Risk Score (FRS).<br> _Inclusion_ of individuals with consent and DNA available; for cases, the participant data includes study adjudication of reported MI and onset prior to age 45y (men) or 55y (women); for comparison (non-MI) participants, there must be data to calculate the Framingham Risk Score (FRS; age, sex, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, blood pressure medications), with age greater than 50y (men) or 60y (women).  > <i>Exclusion<i> of participants with prevalent or incident CVD; cases with self-reported MI but without adjudication of clinical data.  > <p>  _LDL Cholesterol (LDL):_  > Within each of two ethnic groups (whites and blacks), selection of 100 participants with extremely low LDL and 100 participants with extremely high LDL, after adjustment for age, sex, lipid medication status.<br> _Inclusion_ requires consent and available DNA, and presence of the following variables: race, sex, LDL measurement (baseline and any additional), age at LDL measurement, lipid-lowering medication status.  > <i>Exclusion<i>: not being sequenced for other phenotypes.  > <p>  _Blood Pressure (BP):_  > Within each of two ethnic groups (whites and blacks), selection of 200 participants with extremely low residual systolic and diastolic blood pressure and 200 participants with extremely high residual systolic and diastolic blood pressure, after adjustment for age, sex, medication status and BMI.<br> _Inclusion_ requires consent and available DNA, and presence of the following variables: race, sex, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), age, hypertension medication status and BMI.  > <i>Exclusion<i> of participants (or data) with age > 69 yr, prevalent MI, heart failure or BMI > 4SD at any exam but only for that exam (for those participants with multiple measurements); for selection of extreme low BP individuals, exclude those individuals who are on antihypertensive treatment or who are unknown to be on antihypertensive treatment.  > <p>  _Ischemic Stroke (STROKE):_  > Within each of two ethnic groups (whites and blacks), selection of 250 participants with early onset (less than 65y) or positive family history of ischemic stroke.

ARIC is designed to investigate the etiology and natural history of atherosclerosis, the etiology of clinical atherosclerotic diseases, and variation in cardiovascular risk factors, medical care and disease by race, gender, location, and date. The ARIC Cohort Component began in 1987, and each ARIC field center randomly selected and recruited a cohort sample of approximately 4,000 individuals aged 45-64 from a defined population in their community. A total of 15,792 participants received an extensive examination, including medical, social, and demographic data. These participants were re-examined every three years with the first screen (baseline) occurring in 1987-89, the second in 1990-92, the third in 1993-95, and the fourth and last exam was in 1996-98. Follow-up occurs yearly by telephone to maintain contact with participants and to assess health status of the cohort.  :::Study Attribution     * ** Principal Investigator **      * Stephen Rich, PhD.
